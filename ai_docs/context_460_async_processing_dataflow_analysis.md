# Context 460: Async Processing Dataflow Analysis

## Date: January 9, 2025

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the async processing stages for document `eaca69ea-1b5f-48f4-b7a1-6ac73521e0e5`. The pipeline successfully completed OCR, chunking, and entity extraction but encountered an error during relationship building. All core processing stages functioned correctly with proper dataflow between components.

## Document Processing Timeline

### Initial State (01:45:57)
- Document uploaded to S3
- Database record created
- Celery task submitted (Task ID: a0cfe520-125f-465e-81e7-7b62dbe06d7b)

### Async Processing Start (02:45:14)
- Celery worker started
- OCR task picked up from queue

## Detailed Stage Analysis

### Stage 1: OCR Processing (Textract)
**Script**: `scripts/textract_utils.py`
**Key Functions**:
- `TextractManager.start_document_text_detection()`
- `TextractManager.poll_textract_job()`

**Dataflow**:
1. **Input**: 
   - Document UUID: `eaca69ea-1b5f-48f4-b7a1-6ac73521e0e5`
   - S3 location: `s3://samu-docs-private-upload/documents/eaca69ea-1b5f-48f4-b7a1-6ac73521e0e5.pdf`

2. **Processing**:
   - Textract job created: `93045dd310cc0202caae2faa6a88412dbc565c1d049931b22723be8d8c27ada7`
   - Job status: SUCCEEDED
   - Pages processed: 2
   - Text extracted: 2,780 characters

3. **Output**:
   - Raw text stored in `source_documents.raw_extracted_text`
   - Textract job record created in `textract_jobs` table
   - Status: ✅ Success

### Stage 2: Text Chunking
**Script**: `scripts/chunking_utils.py`
**Key Functions**:
- `create_semantic_chunks()`
- `insert_chunks_to_database()`

**Dataflow**:
1. **Input**:
   - Raw text from OCR (2,780 characters)
   - Document UUID

2. **Processing**:
   - Text split into semantic chunks
   - 4 chunks created
   - Total chunk text: 3,380 characters (includes overlap)

3. **Output**:
   - Chunks stored in `document_chunks` table
   - Chunk indices: 0-3
   - Each chunk has `text`, `char_start_index`, `char_end_index`
   - Status: ✅ Success

### Stage 3: Entity Extraction
**Script**: `scripts/entity_service.py`
**Key Functions**:
- `extract_entities_from_chunks()`
- `process_chunk_for_entities()`
- `openai_extract_entities()`

**Dataflow**:
1. **Input**:
   - 4 document chunks
   - OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini model)

2. **Processing**:
   - Each chunk processed for entity extraction
   - 17 entity mentions extracted
   - 4 entity types identified: PERSON, ORG, LOCATION, DATE

3. **Output**:
   - Entity mentions stored in `entity_mentions` table
   - Fields populated: `entity_text`, `entity_type`, `start_char`, `end_char`
   - Status: ✅ Success

### Stage 4: Entity Resolution
**Script**: `scripts/entity_service.py`
**Key Functions**:
- `resolve_entities_simple()`
- `create_canonical_entity()`

**Dataflow**:
1. **Input**:
   - 17 entity mentions

2. **Processing**:
   - Entities deduplicated and resolved
   - 11 canonical entities created
   - Mention counts tracked

3. **Output**:
   - Canonical entities stored in `canonical_entities` table
   - Fields: `canonical_name`, `entity_type`, `mention_count`
   - Entity mentions updated with `canonical_entity_uuid`
   - Status: ✅ Success

### Stage 5: Relationship Building (Failed)
**Script**: `scripts/graph_service.py`
**Key Functions**:
- `build_relationships()`
- `identify_co_occurrences()`

**Dataflow**:
1. **Input**:
   - 11 canonical entities
   - Document chunks

2. **Processing**:
   - 55 relationships identified (all CO_OCCURS type)
   - Relationships staged successfully

3. **Error**:
   - Error occurred: `'dict' object has no attribute 'status'`
   - Location: After staging relationships
   - Impact: Relationships created but task marked as failed

4. **Output**:
   - 55 relationships actually created in `relationship_staging` table
   - But query shows 0 relationships (likely due to missing `source_chunk_uuid`)
   - Status: ❌ Failed (but data partially created)

## Error Analysis

### Primary Error: Relationship Building
**Error**: `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'status'`
**Cause**: The relationship building function returns a dict, but the calling code expects an object with a `status` attribute.
**Location**: `scripts/pdf_tasks.py` in `build_document_relationships` task

### Secondary Error: Manual OCR Trigger
**Error**: `TypeError: extract_text_from_document() missing 1 required positional argument: 'file_path'`
**Cause**: When manually triggering OCR, we didn't provide the required `file_path` argument
**Impact**: No impact on original processing (this was our manual retry)

## Database State After Processing

### Source Documents
- Status: `uploaded` (should be `completed`)
- Celery Status: `None` (not updated due to relationship error)
- Has raw text: ✅ Yes (2,780 chars)

### Processing Results
- **Textract Jobs**: 1 successful job
- **Document Chunks**: 4 chunks created
- **Entity Mentions**: 17 entities extracted
- **Canonical Entities**: 11 unique entities
- **Relationships**: 55 created but not properly linked

## Scripts Execution Order

1. **scripts/batch_submit_2_documents.py** - Initial submission
2. **scripts/intake_service.py** - Document validation and creation
3. **scripts/s3_storage.py** - S3 upload
4. **scripts/pdf_tasks.py** - Celery task orchestration
5. **scripts/textract_utils.py** - OCR processing
6. **scripts/chunking_utils.py** - Text chunking
7. **scripts/entity_service.py** - Entity extraction and resolution
8. **scripts/graph_service.py** - Relationship building

## Model Compliance Observations

### ✅ Correct Usage
- `document_chunks` uses `text` field (not `text_content`)
- `entity_mentions` uses `entity_text`, `start_char`, `end_char`
- `canonical_entities` uses `canonical_name` (not `entity_name`)
- All UUIDs properly used (no ID fields)

### ❌ Issues Found
- `relationship_staging` records missing `source_chunk_uuid` 
- Return type mismatch in relationship building

## Recommendations for Fixes

### 1. Fix Relationship Building Return Type
In `scripts/graph_service.py`, ensure the function returns an object with a `status` attribute or update the caller to handle dict returns.

### 2. Fix Chunk UUID Assignment
Ensure relationships are properly linked to source chunks by setting `source_chunk_uuid`.

### 3. Update Document Status
Implement proper status updates after each stage completion.

### 4. Fix Task Chaining
Ensure failed tasks don't prevent status updates for completed stages.

## Conclusion

The async processing pipeline successfully completed 4 out of 5 stages, demonstrating that:
1. The core dataflow is working correctly
2. Column name compliance is maintained throughout
3. Each stage properly reads from and writes to the correct tables
4. The error in relationship building is a code logic issue, not a schema compliance issue

The document was successfully processed for OCR, chunking, and entity extraction, providing a functional foundation for legal document analysis despite the relationship building error.
