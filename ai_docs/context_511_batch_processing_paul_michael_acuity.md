# Context 511: Batch Processing Implementation for Paul, Michael (Acuity) Documents

## Date: 2025-06-12

### Overview
Successfully implemented batch processing for 10 legal documents from the Paul, Michael (Acuity) case on the upgraded EC2 instance with sufficient resources.

### Instance Upgrade Complete
- Previous: t3.medium (3.7GB RAM) - severely constrained
- Current: Upgraded instance with 15.4GB RAM
- Memory usage: 1.1GB used, 13.4GB free
- Can now run all worker processes without memory constraints

### Database Configuration
- **RDS Endpoint**: database1.cuviucyodbeg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- **Database**: legal_doc_processing
- **PostgreSQL Version**: 17.4
- **Connection**: Direct connection within same security group
- **Tables**: 14 tables including source_documents, document_chunks, entity_mentions, etc.

### Project Setup
- Created new project for batch processing
- **Project Name**: Paul Michael Acuity Batch
- **Project UUID**: 9bae0e44-7de3-43bf-b817-1ddbe2e0f5d1
- **Project FK ID**: 18 (database primary key)
- **Client Name**: Paul, Michael (Acuity)

6. amended complaint for declaratory judgment.pdf (35KB)
7. WOMBAT 000454-000784.pdf (611MB - large file)
8. Paul, Michael - Initial Disclosures - FINAL 1.27.25.pdf (196KB)
9. WOMBAT 000001-000356.pdf (11.6MB)
10. WOMBAT 000396-000445.pdf (1.8MB)

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Environment Setup
- Database URL configured with proper escaping for special characters
- S3 bucket region mismatch handled (bucket in us-east-2, default region us-east-1)
- Redis configured for caching and task management
- Textractor dependencies installed (Pillow, boto3, etc.)

#### 2. Celery Worker Configuration
- Started comprehensive worker handling all queues
- Queues: default, ocr, text, entity, graph, cleanup, batch.high, batch.normal, batch.low
- Concurrency: 4 processes
- Memory limit: 400MB per child process
- Worker successfully started with prefork pool

#### 3. Batch Submission Process
```python
# Key components:
- S3StorageManager for document upload
- DatabaseManager for record creation
- UUID-based file naming (documents/{uuid}.pdf)
- High priority batch submission
- Batch ID: 5287ef37-2256-4b15-b724-b8184386e196
- Task ID: 75c9ce97-96fe-47d6-aaa1-33ea418e088d
```

#### 4. Processing Workflow
1. Upload documents to S3 with UUID naming
2. Create source_documents records in database
3. Submit batch with high priority
4. Batch task creates chord of parallel document processing tasks
5. Each document goes through 6-stage pipeline:
   - OCR (Textract)
   - Text Chunking
   - Entity Extraction
   - Entity Resolution
   - Relationship Building
   - Finalization

### Current Status
- All 10 documents successfully uploaded to S3
- Database records created for all documents
- Batch submitted as high priority
- Initial processing started for first document
- Task ID for first document: 6c60246b-98cd-4e52-b773-170ed61de8f4

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check batch status
python check_batch_status.py

# Monitor with CLI (requires rich library)
python scripts/cli/monitor.py live

# Check Celery tasks
celery -A scripts.celery_app inspect active

# Database query for status
SELECT file_name, status, ocr_completed_at 
FROM source_documents 
WHERE project_fk_id = 18;
```

### Key Findings
1. Batch processing infrastructure is working correctly
2. Documents are properly registered in the database
3. S3 upload with UUID naming is functioning
4. Celery workers are running and accepting tasks
5. Redis caching and batch tracking operational

### Next Steps
1. Monitor OCR completion for all documents
2. Verify chunking and entity extraction
3. Check relationship building results
4. Validate final pipeline completion
5. Generate processing metrics and reports

### Scripts Created
- `/opt/legal-doc-processor/submit_batch_10_docs.py` - Batch submission script
- `/opt/legal-doc-processor/check_batch_status.py` - Status monitoring script

### Lessons Learned
1. Instance sizing is critical - t3.medium was insufficient
2. Proper field mapping between models and database is essential
3. Project FK ID is required for source documents
4. Batch processing provides good parallelization for large document sets
5. UUID-based file naming prevents conflicts and maintains consistency
