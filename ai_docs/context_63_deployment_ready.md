# Context 63: Deployment Ready - E2E Testing Instructions

## Summary
The Phase 1 system has been successfully deployed and is ready for end-to-end testing. All immediate code fixes from context_60 have been implemented, and the frontend has been deployed to Vercel with proper environment configuration.

## Deployment Details

### Frontend URL
https://phase1-doc-processing-joeott-joseph-otts-projects.vercel.app

### Environment Configuration
All required environment variables have been set in Vercel:
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY  
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_DEFAULT_REGION (us-east-2)
- S3_PRIMARY_DOCUMENT_BUCKET

### Backend Services Running
1. **Queue Processor**: Processing documents from the queue
2. **Live Monitor**: Displaying real-time processing status

## Ready for Testing

### Upload Test Document
1. Navigate to: https://phase1-doc-processing-joeott-joseph-otts-projects.vercel.app/upload.html
2. The upload page will load directly 
3. Select a test PDF file (e.g., the Verified+Petition+for+Discovery+of+Assets (1).PDF in the input folder)
4. Fill in project ID: "legal-docs-processing"
5. Click "Upload"

### Monitor Processing
The monitoring dashboard will show:
- Document intake status
- OCR processing (using AWS Textract)
- Text chunking
- Entity extraction (using OpenAI GPT-4)
- Entity resolution
- Relationship building

### Expected Timeline
Based on the test plan in context_62:
- OCR: 10-30 seconds (AWS Textract)
- Entity Extraction: 1-2 minutes (OpenAI GPT-4)
- Entity Resolution: 30-60 seconds
- Relationship Building: 30-60 seconds
- **Total**: 3-5 minutes per document

### Success Criteria
âœ“ Document uploads successfully to S3
âœ“ Queue entry created in Supabase
âœ“ Textract processes the PDF
âœ“ Entities extracted with GPT-4
âœ“ Canonical entities created
âœ“ Relationships staged for Neo4j

### Current Status
- âœ… All code fixes implemented
- âœ… Frontend deployed to Vercel
- âœ… Environment variables configured
- âœ… Queue processor running
- âœ… Monitoring active
- ðŸ”„ Ready for document upload

## Next Steps
1. Upload a test document through the web interface
2. Monitor processing in real-time
3. Verify all stages complete successfully
4. Check database tables for results
5. Document any issues encountered

The system is now ready for the comprehensive end-to-end test as outlined in context_62_end_to_end_test_plan_2.md.
