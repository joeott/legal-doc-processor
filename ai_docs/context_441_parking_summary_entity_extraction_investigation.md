# Context 441: Parking Summary - Entity Extraction Investigation

## Date: June 7, 2025

## Session Summary

### Primary Investigation
We were investigating why entity extraction wasn't working in the legal document processing pipeline. The system was successfully completing OCR and chunking but failing to trigger entity extraction.

### Key Findings

1. **Pipeline Status**:
   - OCR (Textract): ✅ Working
   - Text Chunking: ✅ Working (4 chunks per document)
   - Entity Extraction: ❌ Not triggering automatically
   - Entity Resolution: ⏸️ Pending
   - Relationship Building: ⏸️ Pending

2. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - OpenAI quota exhaustion (HTTP 429 errors)
   - Entity extraction task not being called after chunking completes
   - Possible task chaining issue in `continue_pipeline_after_ocr`

3. **Environment Issues**:
   - Celery workers were running with outdated environment (June 5th)
   - New OpenAI API key wasn't available to workers until restart
   - Fresh API key provided: `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`

### Actions Taken

1. **Worker Restart**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep "[c]elery" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill -9
   celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --loglevel=info > celery_test.log 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Test Document Submission**:
   - Used existing `batch_submit_2_documents.py` script
   - Submitted 2 copies of "Paul, Michael - Lora Prop Disclosure Stmt 10-21-24.pdf"
   - Project: BATCH_2_DOCS_20250607_212628 (ID: 22)
   - Document UUIDs:
     - 9a26d64d-4b84-4ec9-81d6-df393c50bb03
     - f2ec2df8-dc3d-416b-a88c-4f23e4a6e439

3. **CLAUDE.md Update**:
   - Enhanced with current testing commands
   - Added troubleshooting section for entity extraction
   - Updated configuration requirements
   - Added monitoring and log file locations

### Current State

1. **Documents Processed**:
   - Both documents completed OCR successfully
   - Textract job IDs confirmed
   - Raw text extracted (2780 characters each)
   - Chunking completed (4 chunks each)
   - Entity extraction NOT triggered

2. **Database State**:
   ```sql
   -- Both documents show 0 entity mentions
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entity_mentions 
   WHERE document_uuid IN ('9a26d64d-4b84-4ec9-81d6-df393c50bb03', 
                          'f2ec2df8-dc3d-416b-a88c-4f23e4a6e439');
   -- Result: 0
   ```

3. **Log Analysis**:
   - Celery logs show successful OCR and chunking
   - `continue_pipeline_after_ocr` executes but only triggers chunking
   - No entity extraction task submissions found

### Next Steps Required

1. **Fix Task Chaining**:
   - Review `pdf_tasks.py` - `continue_pipeline_after_ocr` function
   - Ensure it calls `extract_entities_from_chunks.apply_async()` after chunking
   - Check the task signature and queue assignment

2. **Verify OpenAI Integration**:
   - Test OpenAI API key directly
   - Check entity_service.py for proper error handling
   - Ensure quota limits are respected

3. **Manual Entity Extraction Test**:
   ```python
   # Manual trigger for testing
   from scripts.pdf_tasks import extract_entities_from_chunks
   extract_entities_from_chunks.apply_async(
       args=['9a26d64d-4b84-4ec9-81d6-df393c50bb03'],
       queue='entity'
   )
   ```

4. **Monitor Pipeline Flow**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/cli/monitor.py live
   # Watch for entity extraction stage
   ```

### Historical Context Reviewed

- **Context 433**: Initial entity extraction failure analysis
- **Context 434**: Fix for saving entities to database
- **Context 435**: OpenAI quota error documentation
- **Context 430**: Batch performance testing setup
- **Context 431**: Textract async-only directive

### Configuration State

```bash
# Current environment settings
OPENAI_API_KEY=[new key provided]
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
ENABLE_SCANNED_PDF_DETECTION=false
SKIP_PDF_PREPROCESSING=true
FORCE_PROCESSING=true
SKIP_CONFORMANCE_CHECK=true
```

### Critical Finding

The pipeline is breaking at the transition from chunking to entity extraction. The `continue_pipeline_after_ocr` function successfully triggers chunking but does not continue to entity extraction. This is a task chaining issue that needs to be fixed in the production code.

## Resume Instructions

To continue this investigation:

1. Check `scripts/pdf_tasks.py` - specifically the `chunk_document_text` task's success handler
2. Verify it triggers `extract_entities_from_chunks` upon completion
3. Test manual entity extraction on the submitted documents
4. Monitor Redis state during pipeline execution
5. Check for any error callbacks or dead letter queue entries
