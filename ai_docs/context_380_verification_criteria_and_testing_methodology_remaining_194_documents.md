## 🚀 EXTENSION STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS

### 1. Immediate Improvements (Before Processing)
```python
# Fix the polling issue
def check_textract_status_simple(job_id):
    """Simple, reliable status checking"""
    response = textract_client.get_document_text_detection(JobId=job_id)
    return response['JobStatus'], response.get('StatusMessage', '')

# Implement batch processing
def process_document_batch(documents, max_concurrent=5):
    """Process multiple documents concurrently"""
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_concurrent) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(process_single_document, doc) for doc in documents[:max_concurrent]]
        return [future.result() for future in futures]
```

        self.start_time = time.time()
        
    def update(self, success=True):
        self.completed += 1
        elapsed = time.time() - self.start_time
        rate = self.completed / (elapsed / 3600)  # docs per hour
        eta = (self.total - self.completed) / rate if rate > 0 else 0
        
        print(f"\rProgress: {self.completed}/{self.total} ({self.completed/self.total*100:.1f}%) "
              f"Rate: {rate:.1f} docs/hr ETA: {eta:.1f} hours", end='')
