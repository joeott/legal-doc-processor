# Context 390: Production Test Implementation Status - Mid-Execution

## Date: 2025-06-04 14:30

### 🚨 CRITICAL STATE: Production Test In Progress

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Phase 1: Database Reset and Preparation** ✅
   - Killed all Celery workers
   - Cleared Redis cache (FLUSHDB successful)
   - Truncated all database tables (CASCADE)
   - Started fresh Celery workers (8 concurrency, all queues)
   - Worker confirmed running at: celery@ip-172-31-33-106

2. **Phase 2: Document Preparation** ✅
   - Created manifest: `production_test_manifest_20250604_142117.json`
   - Project UUID: `4a0db6b4-7f77-4d51-9920-22fdd34eaac8`
   - 201 documents total (2485.3 MB, 2 files >500MB)
   - Created project in database (projects table)
   - Created all 201 documents in source_documents table
   - Uploaded all 201 files to S3 bucket: `samu-docs-private-upload`
   - S3 keys follow pattern: `documents/{document_uuid}/{filename}`

### 🔄 Current State: OCR Processing Started

- `run_production_test.py` executed but tasks returned immediately
- Issue: OCR tasks were failing because files weren't in S3 initially
- Fixed by uploading all files to S3
- Database has been updated with s3_key and s3_bucket for all documents
- Workers are now processing OCR tasks asynchronously

### 📋 Key Files Created

1. **create_production_manifest.py** - Creates test manifest with valid UUIDs
2. **setup_production_test.py** - Creates project and documents in database
3. **upload_files_to_s3.py** - Uploads all files to S3
4. **run_production_test.py** - Orchestrates parallel processing
5. **monitor_production_test.py** - Real-time monitoring dashboard

### 🔧 Critical Configuration

```bash
# Environment loaded via: source load_env.sh
DATABASE_URL_DIRECT=postgresql://app_user:LegalDoc2025%5C%21Secure@database1.cuviucyodbeg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/legal_doc_processing?sslmode=require
S3_PRIMARY_DOCUMENT_BUCKET=samu-docs-private-upload
REDIS: redis-12696.c325.us-east-1-4.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:12696
```

### 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Test

1. **Monitor OCR Progress**:
   ```bash
   # Check text extraction progress
   PGPASSWORD="LegalDoc2025\!Secure" psql -h database1.cuviucyodbeg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -U app_user -d legal_doc_processing -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(raw_extracted_text) as with_text FROM source_documents;"
   ```

2. **Run Pipeline Validation Queries** (Phase 3):
   - See context_388 starting at Step 3.1
   - Verify each stage: OCR → Chunking → Entity Extraction → Resolution → Relationships

3. **Generate Final Report** (Phase 5):
   ```bash
   python3 generate_validation_report.py
   ```

### ⚠️ Known Issues Encountered

1. **Project UUID Format**: Had to use valid UUID, not string name
2. **Database Column Names**: 
   - projects table uses `project_id` not `project_uuid`
   - textract_jobs doesn't have `job_status` column
3. **S3 Requirement**: OCR expects files in S3, not local paths
4. **Worker Environment**: Must source load_env.sh before starting workers

### 📊 Expected Outcomes

- 201 documents should process successfully
- Target: >99% success rate
- Target: <15 minutes total processing time
- Expected: >50,000 entities, >5,000 relationships

### 🔍 Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check Celery worker activity
tail -f celery_worker.log | grep -E "(Starting OCR|Succeeded|Failed)"

# Monitor Redis state
REDISCLI_AUTH="BHMbnJHyf&9!4TT" redis-cli -h redis-12696.c325.us-east-1-4.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com -p 12696 --user joe_ott keys "doc:*" | wc -l

# Check processing tasks
psql -c "SELECT task_name, status, COUNT(*) FROM processing_tasks GROUP BY task_name, status;"
```

### 💡 Critical Implementation Notes

1. All 201 documents are now in:
   - Database (source_documents table)
   - S3 bucket (with proper keys)
   - Redis state tracking initiated

2. The async pipeline should now:
   - Extract text via Textract
   - Save to raw_extracted_text column
   - Trigger chunking
   - Continue through entity extraction
   - Complete with relationship building

3. Monitor for large file handling:
   - 2 files >500MB should trigger splitting
   - Check logs for "split_large_pdf" function calls

### 🎯 Resume Point

The next Claude Code instance should:
1. Check current OCR processing status
2. Wait for pipeline completion
3. Run validation queries from context_388
4. Generate comprehensive report
5. Document results in context_391

All infrastructure is running and processing. Just need to monitor completion and validate results.
