# Context 350: Progress Summary and Current Blockers

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Git Recovery ✓
- Found last working commit: `6e8aa82` (99% success rate)
- Created recovery branches
- Confirmed core pipeline files unchanged during consolidation

### 2. Real Testing Framework ✓
- Created `test_real_document_processing.py` with NO mocks
- Tests actual document processing through all 6 stages
- Provides detailed verification and reporting

### 3. API Mismatch Identification ✓
- Confirmed all API mismatches from context_347:
  - S3: `upload_document` → `upload_document_with_uuid_naming`
  - Redis: `set/get` → `set_cached/get_cached`
  - Database: Context manager issue with `get_db()`
  - Entity Service: Name change confirmed

### 4. Initial Fixes ✓
- Fixed Celery import error (removed missing `resolution_task`)
- Created API compatibility layer
- Got Celery workers running
- Fixed database column name mismatches in test

## Current Status

### Pipeline Submission: ✓ Working
```json
{
  "status": "processing",
  "document_uuid": "c48a5aad-9c51-4b4c-aba9-5c6f4fabd9ba",
  "ocr_task_id": "d441a0bb-4440-4ba5-9058-4b042d3d4fd2",
  "message": "Document processing initiated successfully"
}
```

### Database Record Creation: ✗ FAILING
- Document UUID not found in source_documents table
- No processing_tasks entries created
- Pipeline appears to accept the task but doesn't create database records

## Critical Blocker

The `process_pdf_document` task is not creating the initial database record. This blocks all subsequent processing stages.

### Possible Causes:
1. Database connection issue in Celery worker
2. API mismatch in database operations within pdf_tasks.py
3. Transaction not committing
4. Error being swallowed silently

## Next Immediate Actions

### 1. Debug Database Creation
```python
# Add logging to process_pdf_document to see where it fails
# Check if db_manager is properly initialized
# Verify transaction commits
```

### 2. Create Simple Test Task
```python
@app.task
def test_db_connection():
    """Test if Celery can write to database"""
    from scripts.db import get_db
    from sqlalchemy import text
    
    session = next(get_db())
    try:
        # Simple test query
        result = session.execute(text("SELECT NOW()")).fetchone()
        print(f"Database time: {result[0]}")
        
        # Try to insert a test record
        session.execute(text("""
            INSERT INTO processing_tasks (task_id, task_type, status)
            VALUES (:id, :type, :status)
        """), {
            "id": str(uuid4()),
            "type": "test",
            "status": "completed"
        })
        session.commit()
        print("Test insert successful!")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Database error: {e}")
        session.rollback()
    finally:
        session.close()
```

### 3. Check Worker Logs Properly
- Find where Celery is actually logging
- Check for silent failures
- Add more verbose logging to pipeline

### 4. Test Minimal Pipeline
Once database writes work, test just the first stage:
1. Create document record
2. Verify it exists
3. Then proceed to OCR

## Key Insight

We're very close! The infrastructure is working (Redis, Celery, S3 ready), but the first database write is failing. Once we fix this initial blocker, the rest of the pipeline should follow.

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Document record created in database
- [ ] OCR job submitted to Textract
- [ ] Chunks created from text
- [ ] Entities extracted
- [ ] Entities resolved
- [ ] Relationships built

Current: 0/6 stages working
Target: At least 1/6 (document creation) as next milestone
