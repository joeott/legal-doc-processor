# Context 363: Chunking Recovery Success - Stage 3 Complete!

## Date: 2025-06-03 23:07

### SUCCESS! Chunking Stage Recovered 🎉
We've successfully recovered the text chunking stage, moving from 50% to 60% pipeline completion!

### Key Achievements
- **Chunks Created**: 4 chunks from 3,290 characters
- **Chunk Size**: 1000 chars with 200 char overlap
- **Processing Time**: < 1 second

### Fixes Applied

1. **Column Name Mismatch**
   - Error: `column "text_content" does not exist`
   - Fix: Changed to `text` (actual column name)
   - Also fixed `chunk_metadata` → `metadata_json`

2. **Function Signature Change**
   - Error: `chunk_document_text() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'`
   - Fix: Updated to pass both `document_uuid` AND `text`
   - This is actually better design - more functional/testable

### Working Example
```python
# Correct invocation
from scripts.pdf_tasks import chunk_document_text
result = chunk_document_text.delay(document_uuid, extracted_text)
```

### Chunk Results
- Chunk 0: 1000 chars (start: 0, end: 1000)
- Chunk 1: 1000 chars (start: 800, end: 1800) - 200 char overlap
- Chunk 2: 1000 chars (start: 1600, end: 2600) - 200 char overlap
- Chunk 3: 890 chars (start: 2400, end: 3290) - remaining text

### Pipeline Progress Update
1. ✓ Document Creation
2. ✓ OCR/Textract 
3. ✓ Text Chunking **← NEW!**
4. ○ Entity Extraction
5. ○ Entity Resolution
6. ○ Relationship Building

### What's Different from Before

The chunking task now requires the text to be passed explicitly rather than fetching it from the database. This is a cleaner design pattern that:
- Makes the function more testable
- Reduces database dependencies
- Allows for text preprocessing if needed
- Enables easier debugging

### Next Steps

1. **Automatic Pipeline Flow**
   - Currently we're triggering each stage manually
   - Need to check if pipeline continues automatically after chunking
   - May need to fix the `continue_pipeline_after_ocr` logic

2. **Entity Extraction (Stage 4)**
   - Expected issues: OpenAI API changes, column names
   - Test with: `extract_entities_from_chunks.delay(document_uuid)`

### Key Learning
The consolidation actually improved some aspects of the code architecture by making functions more pure and reducing side effects. The chunking function is now more modular and reusable.

### Commands for Next Stage
```bash
# Test entity extraction
from scripts.pdf_tasks import extract_entities_from_chunks
result = extract_entities_from_chunks.delay('4909739b-8f12-40cd-8403-04b8b1a79281')

# Monitor progress
python3 scripts/monitor_document_complete.py 4909739b-8f12-40cd-8403-04b8b1a79281
```

Progress: 60% complete (3 of 6 stages working)
