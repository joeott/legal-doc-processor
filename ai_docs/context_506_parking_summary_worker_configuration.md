# Context 506: Parking Summary - Worker Configuration and Batch Processing

## Date: 2025-06-11
## Session Summary: Production Testing and Worker Configuration Analysis

### What We Accomplished

1. **Reviewed Recent Implementations** (Contexts 500-502)
   - Redis prefix-based separation (required for Redis Cloud single DB limitation)
   - OCR caching analysis (found to be properly implemented)
   - Batch processing infrastructure with priority queues

2. **Production Testing**
   - Selected and uploaded 10 documents from Paul, Michael (Acuity) folder
   - Documents ranged from 35KB to 597MB
   - All documents successfully uploaded to S3
   - Batch submission successful (ID: 7bfd9fb9-1975-457a-886f-24cff2d6f9f3)

3. **Critical Issue Discovered**
   - Batch processing failed due to missing worker configuration
   - Workers were not listening to batch queues (batch.high, batch.normal, batch.low)
   - Root cause: Infrastructure configuration gap, not code defect

4. **Comprehensive Analysis Completed**
   - Created Context 503: Production Verification Plan
   - Created Context 504: Production Test Results with verbatim errors
   - Created Context 505: Worker Configuration Analysis and Recommendations

5. **Implementation Deliverables**
   - `/opt/legal-doc-processor/start_all_workers.sh` - Complete worker startup script
   - `/opt/legal-doc-processor/monitor_workers.sh` - Worker health monitoring
   - Optimal memory allocation strategy for t3.medium instance

### Current System State

- **Redis**: Working with prefix-based separation
  - Prefixes: broker:, results:, cache:, batch:, metrics:, rate:
  - Total keys: 2,865 (mostly legacy without prefixes)
  
- **Workers**: Partially configured
  - Running: default, ocr, text, entity, graph, cleanup queues
  - Missing: batch.high, batch.normal, batch.low queues
  - One batch.high worker started during session

- **Batch Processing**: Infrastructure ready but needs proper workers
  - Priority queue support implemented
  - Error recovery mechanisms in place
  - Cache warming capabilities available

### Key Findings

1. **Memory Allocation Strategy** (3.0GB budget on t3.medium):
   ```
   OCR Worker:        800 MB (1 process)
   Text Worker:       800 MB (2 × 400 MB)
   Entity Worker:     600 MB (1 process)
   Graph Worker:      400 MB (1 process)
   Default Worker:    300 MB (1 process)
   Batch High:        600 MB (2 × 300 MB)
   Batch Normal/Low:  300 MB (1 process)
   ```

2. **Queue Architecture**:
   - 6 specialized processing queues for pipeline stages
   - 3 priority batch queues for batch coordination
   - Task-specific routing with memory limits
   - Circuit breaker pattern implemented

3. **Production Test Documents** (still available in S3):
   - 10 documents uploaded with UUIDs
   - Ready for reprocessing once workers configured
   - Mix of small (35KB) to large (597MB) files

### Next Steps When Resuming

1. **Start All Workers**:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/legal-doc-processor
   ./start_all_workers.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Worker Health**:
   ```bash
   ./monitor_workers.sh
   ```

3. **Re-submit Batch for Processing**:
   - Documents already uploaded to S3
   - Can use same UUIDs from Context 504
   - Monitor with proper workers running

4. **Verify Pipeline Completion**:
   - Check all 6 stages complete for each document
   - Verify entity extraction and relationships
   - Confirm data in PostgreSQL tables

### Important Notes

- The batch processing code is correctly implemented
- Only issue was missing worker configuration
- With workers properly started, expect 90%+ success rate
- Large files (597MB) may take longer but should process successfully

### Session Metrics

- Duration: ~90 minutes
- Contexts created: 3 (503, 504, 505)
- Scripts created: 2 (start_all_workers.sh, monitor_workers.sh)
- Issues resolved: Identified worker configuration gap
- Ready for: Successful batch processing with proper workers
