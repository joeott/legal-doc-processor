## Commands for Testing During Implementation

### Monitor Progress
```bash
# Watch processing in real-time
python scripts/standalone_pipeline_monitor.py --refresh-interval 2

# Check recent image processing status
python -c "
from scripts.supabase_utils import SupabaseManager
db = SupabaseManager()
result = db.client.table('source_documents').select('id, original_file_name, file_category, celery_status').eq('file_category', 'image').order('id', desc=True).limit(10).execute()
for doc in result.data:
    print(f'{doc[\"id\"]}: {doc[\"original_file_name\"]} - {doc[\"celery_status\"]}')
"
```

### Test Single Image
```bash
# Test image processing directly
python -c "
from scripts.image_processing import ImageProcessor
processor = ImageProcessor()
result = processor.process_image('test-s3-key', 'IMG_0123.HEIC')
print(result)
"
```

### Import Test with Images
```bash
# Import specific folder with images
python scripts/import_from_manifest_fixed.py input_manifest.json --workers 1 --batch-size 1

# Check Celery worker status
celery -A scripts.celery_app inspect active

# Start Flower monitoring
celery -A scripts.celery_app flower
```

### Database Verification
```bash
# Check image processing results
python -c "
from scripts.supabase_utils import SupabaseManager
db = SupabaseManager()
result = db.client.table('source_documents').select('original_file_name, extracted_text, image_type, image_analysis_confidence').eq('file_category', 'image').eq('celery_status', 'completed').execute()
for doc in result.data:
    print(f'{doc[\"original_file_name\"]}: {doc[\"image_type\"]} - Confidence: {doc[\"image_analysis_confidence\"]}')
    print(f'Description: {doc[\"extracted_text\"][:100]}...')
    print('---')

## Notes for Implementation

### Key Dependencies
- OpenAI API key must be configured
- Celery workers must be running
- Redis connection for Celery
- S3 bucket access for image storage
- Supabase database access

### Critical Testing Files
- **Primary Test**: `IMG_0123.HEIC` (iOS photo)
- **Document Test**: `Gibbs Signed Doc.jpg` (signed legal document)
- **Batch Test**: All files in `/input/folder_c_mixed_media/`

### Expected Outcomes per Task Phase
- **Phase 1-2**: Infrastructure ready, can process single image
- **Phase 3-4**: Celery integration working, automatic routing
- **Phase 5-6**: Monitoring active, tests passing
- **Phase 7-8**: Full import working, performance validated

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, image processing can be disabled by:
1. Reverting Celery task routing to always use existing OCR
2. Setting file_category to 'document' for problematic images
3. Processing can continue without vision capabilities

This task list provides comprehensive coverage of the vision implementation with clear checkboxes for tracking progress and specific test files for validation.
