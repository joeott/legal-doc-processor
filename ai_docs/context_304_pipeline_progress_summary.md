# Context 304: Pipeline Progress Summary

## Major Achievements

### 1. ✅ Job ID Persistence Fixed
- Fixed database session management in `textract_job_manager.py`
- Job IDs now successfully persist to database
- Example: Document `5805f7b5-09ca-4f95-a990-da2dd758fd9e` has job ID `3b2052d56be96b739a7245ea1a36a6e434993b63b02bb98fa7034cb544cca8ad`

### 2. ✅ OCR Processing Complete
- Textract job completed successfully
- Status: `SUCCEEDED`
- Extracted 3,278 characters from 2 pages
- OCR results cached in Redis

### 3. ✅ Polling Mechanism Working
- Fixed exception handling in `poll_textract_job` task
- Polling successfully detects job completion
- Triggers next stage after OCR

### 4. ❌ Chunking Stage Failed
- Pipeline states show `chunking: failed`
- Text not yet stored in database (Has Extracted Text: False)
- No chunks created (Chunks Created: 0)

## Current Pipeline State

```
OCR: ✅ Completed
- Job ID persisted
- Text extracted
- Results cached

Chunking: ❌ Failed
- Task triggered but failed
- Need to investigate error

Entity Extraction: ⏳ Pending
- Waiting for successful chunking

Resolution: ⏳ Pending
- Waiting for entities

Relationships: ⏳ Pending
- Waiting for resolution
```

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Chunking Failure**
   - Check text worker logs
   - Verify text is being passed correctly
   - Check for database write issues

2. **Fix Text Storage**
   - Ensure extracted text is saved to `raw_extracted_text` field
   - Update `ocr_completed_at` timestamp

3. **Complete Pipeline**
   - Once chunking works, verify entity extraction
   - Test full end-to-end flow

## Technical Notes

### Files Fixed
- `scripts/textract_job_manager.py`: Database session management
- `scripts/pdf_tasks.py`: Exception handling in polling task

### Worker Status
- OCR worker: Running, processing jobs successfully
- Text worker: Running, but chunking tasks failing
- Entity/Graph workers: Waiting for upstream tasks

### Environment
- All workers have AWS credentials
- Redis caching working
- Database connections stable
