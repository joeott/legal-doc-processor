# Context 339: Redis Client Attribute Error - Production Verification

## Error Description

During production readiness verification, Redis connectivity test failed with:
```
Error: 'RedisManager' object has no attribute 'client'
```

## Environment

- Working directory: /opt/legal-doc-processor
- Python imports: Successfully fixed
- Database connection: ✅ PASS
- S3 initialization: ✅ PASS
- Redis connection: ❌ FAIL

## Root Cause

The verification script tries to access `redis.client.ping()` but the RedisManager class doesn't expose a `client` attribute directly. The Redis client is likely internal to the manager.

## Test Results Summary

### Phase 1: Environment & Dependencies
- **15/17 passed** (88% pass rate)
- Environment variables: ❌ FAIL (missing REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT, REDIS_PASSWORD)
- Database connectivity: ✅ PASS
- Redis connectivity: ❌ FAIL (attribute error)
- S3 initialization: ✅ PASS
- All module imports: ✅ PASS (13/13)

### Overall Progress
- Total Tests: 33
- Passed: 16 (48.5%)
- Failed: 3
- Skipped: 13 (these require actual documents/running system)

## Fixes Applied

1. **Import Path Fix**: Added sys.path configuration to both verification scripts
2. **Database Connection**: Working correctly with RDS
3. **Module Imports**: All core modules importing successfully

## Remaining Issues

1. **Redis Environment Variables**: Not set in current environment
2. **Redis Client Access**: Need to fix the ping test method
3. **Pydantic Model Import**: SourceDocument not found in scripts.models

## Next Steps

1. Fix Redis connectivity test to use correct method
2. Check if Redis environment variables are needed (might be using Redis Cloud config)
3. Fix Pydantic model import issue
4. Run actual document processing tests once connectivity is fixed
