# Context 504: Production Test Results - Batch Processing Failure

## Date: 2025-06-11
## Test Timestamp: 20:17:39 - 20:27:39 (timeout after 10 minutes)

## Executive Summary

The production test encountered a critical failure where the batch was submitted but not processed due to missing Celery workers for batch queues. All 10 documents were successfully uploaded to S3, but the processing pipeline did not execute.

### Batch Configuration
- **Batch ID**: `7bfd9fb9-1975-457a-886f-24cff2d6f9f3`
- **Project UUID**: `63105ec7-b33a-4342-a126-4763d9ad8279`

## Test Results

### Phase 1: S3 Upload ✅ SUCCESS
- **Result**: 10/10 documents uploaded successfully
- **Duration**: ~13 seconds
- **Total Size Uploaded**: ~609.4 MB
- **No Errors**: All uploads completed without issues

### Phase 2: Batch Submission ✅ SUCCESS
- **Task ID**: `24b47ec1-2efb-41ff-bd5c-a0b9b7047ec8`
- **Queue**: `batch.high`
- **Submission Time**: 2025-06-11 20:17:54

### Phase 3: Batch Processing ❌ FAILED
- **Status**: Task submitted but not picked up by workers
- **Root Cause**: No Celery workers configured for batch queues
- **Error Type**: Infrastructure/Configuration Error

## Verbatim Error Documentation

### Initial Upload Error (Fixed)
```
AttributeError: 'S3StorageManager' object has no attribute 'upload_document'
```
**Fix Applied**: Changed method call to `upload_document_with_uuid_naming`

### Worker Configuration Issue
```
Celery workers running:
ubuntu    279458  ... celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --loglevel=info --queues=default,ocr,text,entity,graph,cleanup
```
**Issue**: Workers are only listening to standard queues, not batch queues (`batch.high`, `batch.normal`, `batch.low`)

### Redis State
- Total keys: 2,865
- Batch progress key not found: `batch:progress:7bfd9fb9-1975-457a-886f-24cff2d6f9f3`
- Queue state: 3 messages in `batch.high9` queue (unrelated to our batch)

### Database Connection Issues
```
psql: error: could not translate host name "-U" to address: Name or service not known
```
**Issue**: Database environment variables not properly loaded or named differently

## Pipeline Stage Verification

| Stage | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| OCR | ❓ Not Started | No tasks created |
| Chunking | ❓ Not Started | No chunks created |
| Entity Extraction | ❓ Not Started | No entities extracted |
| Entity Resolution | ❓ Not Started | No resolution performed |
| Relationship Building | ❓ Not Started | No relationships built |
| Finalization | ❓ Not Started | Pipeline never completed |

## System State Analysis

### Pre-Test State
- Redis keys total: ~2,865
- Cache keys: 6 (with prefix `cache:`)
- Metrics keys: 5 (with prefix `metrics:`)
- Batch keys: 0 (with prefix `batch:`)

### Infrastructure Status
- **Redis**: ✅ Connected and healthy
- **S3**: ✅ Connected and functional (us-east-2 region)
- **Database**: ❌ Connection issues (environment variables)
- **Celery Workers**: ⚠️ Running but misconfigured (missing batch queues)

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Issue**: Celery workers are not configured to process batch queues
   - Current workers only monitor: `default,ocr,text,entity,graph,cleanup`
   - Missing queues: `batch.high`, `batch.normal`, `batch.low`

2. **Secondary Issue**: Database connection configuration
   - Environment variables not properly set or named differently
   - Prevents verification of processing_tasks table

3. **Configuration Gap**: The batch processing system requires dedicated workers that weren't started

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Start Batch Processing Workers**
```bash
# Kill existing workers
ps aux | grep "[c]elery" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill -9

# Start comprehensive workers
celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --loglevel=info --queues=default,ocr,text,entity,graph,cleanup &
celery -A scripts.celery_app worker -Q batch.high -n batch-high@%h --concurrency=4 &
celery -A scripts.celery_app worker -Q batch.normal -n batch-normal@%h --concurrency=2 &
celery -A scripts.celery_app worker -Q batch.low -n batch-low@%h --concurrency=1 &
```

2. **Fix Database Connection**
- Verify correct environment variable names
- Ensure DATABASE_URL or equivalent is properly set
- Test connection before running batch

3. **Re-run Test**
- Documents are already uploaded to S3
- Can re-submit batch with same UUIDs
- Monitor with proper workers running

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Worker Management**
- Use supervisor or systemd for worker management
- Ensure all required queues are covered
- Add health checks for worker status

2. **Monitoring Enhancement**
- Add pre-flight checks before batch submission
- Verify worker availability for target queues
- Alert on missing workers

3. **Error Handling**
- Add timeout handling for batch submission
- Implement worker health checks in batch tasks
- Better error messages for configuration issues

## Test Artifacts

- **Log File**: `/opt/legal-doc-processor/production_test_20250611_201738.log`
- **Output File**: `/opt/legal-doc-processor/production_test_output.log`
- **S3 Uploads**: All documents successfully uploaded and available

## Conclusion

The test revealed a critical configuration gap in the Celery worker setup. While the batch processing infrastructure is properly implemented (Redis prefixes, batch tasks, S3 integration), the workers need to be configured to process batch-specific queues. Once workers are properly started, the batch processing should function as designed.

**Success Rate**: 0% (due to infrastructure issue, not code defects)
**Next Steps**: Configure workers and re-run test
