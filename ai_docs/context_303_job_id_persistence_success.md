# Context 303: Job ID Persistence Success

## Major Achievement

We have successfully fixed the job ID persistence issue! The Textract job ID is now being properly stored in the database.

### What Was Fixed

1. **Database Session Management**: The `textract_job_manager.py` was using a context manager (`with db_manager.get_session()`) but `get_session()` returns a generator, not a context manager. Fixed by:
   ```python
   # Old (incorrect):
   with db_manager.get_session() as session:
   
   # New (correct):
   session = next(db_manager.get_session())
   try:
       # operations
   finally:
       session.close()
   ```

2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to track job ID persistence:
   - Log when attempting to update document status
   - Log the number of rows updated
   - Log full tracebacks on errors

### Successful Test Result

Document UUID: `5805f7b5-09ca-4f95-a990-da2dd758fd9e`
- Textract Job ID: `3b2052d56be96b739a7245ea1a36a6e434993b63b02bb98fa7034cb544cca8ad`
- Textract Status: `IN_PROGRESS`
- Job ID successfully persisted to database

## Current Status

The pipeline now:
1. ✅ Creates documents visible to workers
2. ✅ Submits OCR jobs to Textract
3. ✅ Persists job IDs to database
4. ⏳ Polling mechanism needs verification

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Polling**: The `poll_textract_job` task should be scheduled but doesn't appear to be running
2. **Check Task Routing**: Ensure polling tasks are routed to the correct queue
3. **Monitor OCR Completion**: Wait for Textract job to complete and trigger next stages
