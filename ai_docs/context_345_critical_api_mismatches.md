# Context 345: Critical API Mismatches - Production Blocking Issues

## Executive Summary

Production testing revealed 100% failure rate due to API mismatches throughout the codebase. These issues completely prevent the system from serving its mission of reducing legal inequality.

## Critical Failures by Component

### 1. Database Operations ❌
**Error**: `Textual SQL expression 'SELECT version()' should be explicitly declared as text('SELECT version()')`
**Cause**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 requires explicit text() wrapping for raw SQL
**Impact**: No data can be stored or retrieved
**Fix Required**:
```python
from sqlalchemy import text
session.execute(text("SELECT version()"))
```

### 2. S3 Storage ❌
**Error**: `'S3StorageManager' object has no attribute 'upload_document'`
**Cause**: Method doesn't exist in S3StorageManager class
**Impact**: Cannot upload documents for processing
**Fix Required**: Check actual S3StorageManager methods

### 3. Redis Caching ❌
**Error**: `'RedisManager' object has no attribute 'set'`
**Cause**: RedisManager uses different method names
**Impact**: Cannot cache any results
**Fix Required**: Use proper RedisManager API (set_cached, get_cached)

### 4. Entity Extraction ❌
**Error**: `cannot import name 'EntityExtractionService'`
**Cause**: Class doesn't exist with that name
**Impact**: Cannot extract parties, dates, or case information
**Fix Required**: Use correct class name from entity_service.py

## System Fitness Assessment

**COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL**

The system cannot:
- Store any data (database API mismatch)
- Upload documents (S3 API mismatch)  
- Cache results (Redis API mismatch)
- Extract entities (service not found)

## Impact on Justice Mission

With 0% functionality, the system:
- **Cannot process legal documents** - Maintains barriers to justice
- **Cannot extract case information** - Information remains inaccessible
- **Cannot store results** - No lasting impact possible
- **Cannot help anyone** - Inequality persists

## Root Cause Analysis

The codebase appears to have:
1. **Inconsistent APIs** - Methods called don't match implementations
2. **Missing imports** - Services referenced don't exist
3. **Version mismatches** - SQLAlchemy 2.0 vs 1.4 syntax
4. **No integration testing** - Components never tested together

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1: Fix Database Access
```python
from sqlalchemy import text
# All raw SQL must use text()
result = session.execute(text("SELECT ..."))
```

### Priority 2: Verify S3 Methods
```python
# Check actual S3StorageManager implementation
# Use correct method names
```

### Priority 3: Fix Redis API
```python
# Use RedisManager's actual methods:
redis.set_cached(key, value)
value = redis.get_cached(key)
```

### Priority 4: Find Entity Service
```python
# Check what's actually in entity_service.py
# Use correct class/function names
```

## Recommendation

**DO NOT DEPLOY** - The system is completely non-functional.

Before any production use:
1. Fix all API mismatches
2. Run integration tests
3. Verify each component works
4. Test full document flow
5. Only then consider deployment

The current state would actively harm the mission by:
- Failing to process any documents
- Wasting time and resources
- Potentially losing critical legal data
- Maintaining the exact inequalities we aim to fix

## Next Steps

1. Audit each module's actual API
2. Fix all method calls to match
3. Add integration tests
4. Re-run production verification
5. Only proceed if >95% success rate achieved
