# Context 270: Current Status and Roadblocks

## Date: 2025-05-31

### Current Status
We are attempting to process a legal document through the pipeline end-to-end. The document has been successfully uploaded to S3 and a database record created, but the Celery OCR task is failing.

### What's Working
1. **Infrastructure**
   - EC2 instance with direct RDS access (no SSH tunneling needed)
   - Supervisor managing 5 Celery workers (all running)
   - Redis cache connection working
   - S3 storage working (documents uploading successfully)

2. **Database**
   - RDS PostgreSQL connection working
   - Schema mostly aligned (8/9 tests passing)
   - Projects and documents tables functional
   - Test project created successfully

3. **Document Import**
   - CLI import tool updated to remove Supabase references
   - S3 upload working
   - Document records being created in database

### Current Roadblocks

#### 1. Document Validation Failure in Celery Task
**Problem**: The OCR Celery task fails with "Document not found in database" even though the document exists.

**Evidence**:
- Document UUID: `a4d38b3b-c580-4f9a-bd8c-1da0e9c9e729`
- Document exists in database (verified via direct SQL query)
- `validate_document_exists()` function in pdf_tasks.py returns False

**Suspected Causes**:
- DatabaseManager instance in Celery worker might have different connection/context
- Conformance validation errors might be interfering
- Possible transaction isolation issue

#### 2. Conformance Validation Errors
**Problem**: Persistent error: `'ConformanceReport' object has no attribute 'validation_results'`

**Impact**:
- Appears in logs but doesn't stop execution
- May be causing downstream issues with database operations
- Makes debugging harder due to noise in logs

#### 3. Environment Variable Loading in Celery
**Problem**: When trying to debug, DATABASE_URL environment variable not accessible in Python scripts

**Attempted Solutions**:
- Using `source .env`
- Using `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)`
- Both approaches failed

**Possible Issues**:
- Celery workers might have different environment
- systemd/Supervisor environment isolation

### Code Changes Made

1. **Fixed Import Tool** (`scripts/cli/import.py`):
   - Removed SupabaseManager references
   - Fixed S3 upload return value handling
   - Updated database calls to use DatabaseManager

2. **Created Simple OCR Wrapper** (`scripts/ocr_simple.py`):
   - Handles S3 URIs properly
   - Works with just file_path parameter
   - Integrates with TextractProcessor

3. **Updated PDF Tasks** (`scripts/pdf_tasks.py`):
   - Skip local file existence check for S3 paths
   - Import ocr_simple instead of ocr_extraction

4. **Created Test Utilities**:
   - `scripts/tests/create_test_project.py` - Creates test project
   - `scripts/tests/check_document_status.py` - Checks processing status
   - `scripts/tests/process_single_document.py` - Processes single document

### Immediate Next Steps Needed

1. **Fix Document Validation Issue**:
   - Add detailed logging to `validate_document_exists()`
   - Check if Celery workers have proper database connection
   - Verify environment variables in Celery context

2. **Debug Conformance Validation**:
   - Fix or disable the problematic validation
   - Update ConformanceReport class to have validation_results attribute

3. **Complete End-to-End Test**:
   - Get OCR task working
   - Verify text chunking
   - Test entity extraction
   - Confirm graph building

### Key Insight
The system is very close to working - all the pieces are in place, but there's a disconnect between the Celery worker context and the database context that's preventing document validation from succeeding. This is likely the last major hurdle before achieving end-to-end document processing.
