# Context 520: Pipeline Processing Speed Analysis

**Date**: 2025-06-13 01:35 UTC  
**Status**: Active processing with performance metrics  
**Analysis**: Document processing pipeline performance and sample outputs

## Executive Summary

The legal document processing pipeline is actively processing documents with 274 documents having completed OCR, 93 completed chunking, and 92 completed entity extraction/resolution. No documents show as "completed" in the source_documents table - they remain in "pending" or "uploaded" status despite pipeline stages completing.

## Processing Speed by Stage

### Stage Duration Statistics

| Stage | Documents Processed | Avg Duration (seconds) | Min Duration | Max Duration |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **OCR** | 275 | 20.39s | 1.79s | 155.98s |
| **Chunking** | 94 | 0.068s | 0.01s | 0.57s |
| **Entity Extraction** | 93 | 42.53s | 0.08s | 292.76s |
| **Entity Resolution** | 93 | 0.023s | 0.007s | 0.32s |

### Inter-Stage Wait Times

Average time between stage completions:
- OCR → Chunking: 24.17 minutes (1449.97s)
- Chunking → Entity Extraction: 17.86 seconds
- Entity Extraction → Entity Resolution: 11.20 seconds

The large gap between OCR and Chunking suggests either:
1. Queue congestion
2. Worker availability issues
3. Redis caching overhead

## Sample Extracted Content

### 1. Document Chunks
Recent chunks show varied content types:

### 2. Entity Extractions

Recent entity extractions demonstrate high confidence scores:

## Pipeline Bottlenecks

### 1. Document Status Mismatch
- 459 documents show as "pending" in source_documents
- Yet 274 have completed OCR, 93 have progressed through chunking
- Final status update appears to be missing

### 2. Stage Progression Drop-off
- OCR: 274 documents (100%)
- Chunking: 93 documents (33.9%)
- Entity Extraction: 92 documents (33.6%)
- Entity Resolution: 92 documents (33.6%)

This suggests a bottleneck after OCR completion.

### 3. Processing Time Variance
Entity extraction shows high variance (0.08s - 292.76s), likely due to:
- Document size differences
- OpenAI API rate limiting (observed in logs)
- Content complexity

## Active Processing Evidence

Recent activity (last 30 minutes):
- Entity resolution completing rapidly (0.007-0.047s per document)
- Entity extraction actively processing with OpenAI rate limiting delays
- Multiple documents progressing through stages concurrently

## Key Performance Insights

1. **Fast Stages**: Chunking (68ms avg) and Entity Resolution (23ms avg) are extremely efficient
2. **Slow Stages**: OCR (20.4s avg) and Entity Extraction (42.5s avg) are the primary time consumers
3. **Queue Delays**: 24-minute average wait between OCR and Chunking indicates processing backlog
4. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple workers handling different stages simultaneously
5. **Rate Limiting**: OpenAI API rate limits causing delays in entity extraction

## Recommendations

1. **Increase Chunking Workers**: The 24-minute bottleneck suggests more workers needed for text queue
2. **Implement Batch Entity Extraction**: Group multiple chunks for OpenAI API calls
3. **Add Status Updates**: Implement document status updates when all stages complete
4. **Monitor Queue Depths**: Add metrics for queue backlogs to identify bottlenecks
5. **Optimize OCR Caching**: Pre-warm OCR cache for known document types

## Current System Load

- Total documents in system: 459 pending
- Documents with completed OCR: 274 (59.7%)
- Documents fully processed through entity resolution: 92 (20.0%)
- Active processing rate: ~3-4 documents/minute through entity extraction

The pipeline is functioning but experiencing throughput limitations primarily at the OCR→Chunking transition and during entity extraction API calls.
