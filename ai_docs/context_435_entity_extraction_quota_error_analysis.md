# Context 435: Entity Extraction OpenAI Quota Error Analysis

## Date: June 6, 2025

## Executive Summary

A detailed analysis of the entity extraction failures during live production data processing reveals that **ALL entity extraction attempts are failing due to OpenAI API quota exhaustion**, not a code issue. The system is functioning correctly but cannot extract entities because the OpenAI account has exceeded its usage limits.

## Evidence from Production Logs

### 1. Consistent HTTP 429 Errors

Every single OpenAI API call returns HTTP status code 429 (Too Many Requests):

```
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests"
```

### 2. Explicit Quota Exhaustion Message

The OpenAI API returns a clear error message indicating quota exhaustion:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.",
    "type": "insufficient_quota",
    "param": null,
    "code": "insufficient_quota"
  }
}
```

### 3. Retry Pattern Shows Persistent Failure

The OpenAI client implements automatic retry logic with exponential backoff:

```
INFO:openai._base_client:Retrying request to /chat/completions in 0.482732 seconds
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests"
INFO:openai._base_client:Retrying request to /chat/completions in 0.915924 seconds
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests"
```

Each request attempts 3 times before giving up, and ALL retries fail with the same 429 error.

### 4. Entity Extraction Returns 0 Entities

After the API failures, the entity service gracefully handles the error:

```
ERROR:scripts.entity_service:OpenAI entity extraction failed: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota...', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', ...}}
INFO:scripts.entity_service:Successfully extracted 0 entities from chunk 73d727ee-00c0-4aad-bb3b-a931d927ee7f
```

### 5. Pattern Across All Documents

The same pattern repeats for every chunk of every document:
- Chunk processing starts
- API call fails with 429
- 3 retries all fail with 429
- 0 entities returned
- Process continues to next chunk

## Impact on Pipeline

### Documents Processed (June 6, 2025)

1. **Document 11806261-4ef1-41f2-beeb-c0f28b1d7304**
   - Chunks: 4
   - Entities extracted per chunk: 0
   - Total entities: 0

2. **Document 857e516c-d39c-4aee-b151-f3fc450241a4**
   - Chunks: 4
   - Entities extracted per chunk: 0
   - Total entities: 0

### Pipeline Stage Results

```
INFO:scripts.pdf_tasks:Updated state for document 857e516c-d39c-4aee-b151-f3fc450241a4: entity_extraction -> completed
INFO:scripts.pdf_tasks:Starting entity resolution for document 857e516c-d39c-4aee-b151-f3fc450241a4
INFO:scripts.pdf_tasks:Resolving 0 entity mentions for document 857e516c-d39c-4aee-b151-f3fc450241a4
INFO:scripts.pdf_tasks:Updated state for document 857e516c-d39c-4aee-b151-f3fc450241a4: entity_resolution -> completed
```

The pipeline continues normally but with no data to process.

## Configuration Analysis

The system is configured to use:
- **Entity Extraction**: `gpt-4o-mini` model
- **Entity Resolution**: `gpt-4` model (or configured alternative)

Both would work correctly if the API quota was available.

## Root Cause Determination

### Supporting Evidence for Quota Exhaustion:

1. **Error Code Specificity**: HTTP 429 with `insufficient_quota` is unambiguous
2. **Consistency**: 100% of API calls fail with the same error
3. **Timing**: Immediate failures suggest hard quota limit, not rate limiting
4. **OpenAI Documentation**: The error message links to OpenAI's quota documentation
5. **No Code Issues**: The system handles errors gracefully and continues processing

### Counter Evidence Considered:

1. **API Key Issues**: Would return 401 Unauthorized, not 429
2. **Model Access**: Would return 404 or 403, not 429
3. **Rate Limiting**: Would succeed occasionally between retries
4. **Network Issues**: Would show connection errors, not clean HTTP responses

## System Behavior Analysis

The system is behaving correctly:

1. **Error Handling**: Catches OpenAI exceptions properly
2. **Logging**: Records detailed error information
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Returns empty results instead of crashing
4. **Pipeline Continuation**: Downstream tasks handle empty inputs correctly
5. **State Management**: Updates Redis state appropriately

## Conclusion

The entity extraction failure is definitively caused by **OpenAI API quota exhaustion**, not any code or configuration issue. The error messages are explicit and consistent across all attempts. The system's error handling is working as designed, preventing cascading failures.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Check OpenAI account dashboard at https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. **Verify**: Current plan limits and usage statistics
3. **Resolve**: Either:
   - Add payment method/credits to the account
   - Upgrade to a higher tier plan
   - Wait for monthly quota reset
4. **Monitor**: Implement quota usage monitoring to prevent future exhaustion
5. **Fallback**: Consider implementing local NER models for quota emergencies

## Alternative Hypothesis Considered and Rejected

**Hypothesis**: "We should have sufficient quota"

**Counter-evidence**: 
- OpenAI's API explicitly states "You exceeded your current quota"
- This is not a rate limit (requests/minute) but a usage quota (total tokens/dollars)
- The account may have:
  - Exhausted free tier credits
  - Reached monthly spending limit
  - Had payment method issues
  - Been using more expensive models than budgeted

The evidence conclusively supports quota exhaustion as the sole cause of entity extraction failures.
