# Context 518: Batch Processing Status Analysis

## Date: 2025-06-12

### Executive Summary
Analysis of the batch processing errors and current system status reveals multiple critical issues:

1. **No Celery workers are running** - This is why all documents remain in "pending" status
2. **Redis WRONGTYPE errors** - The monitor.py expects hash types but batch progress keys are stored as strings
3. **Monitor.py has broken Supabase references** - The code was partially migrated from Supabase to RDS but not completed
4. **Campaign ID mismatch** - The campaign_205692f0_20250612_231117 doesn't exist in Redis

### Current System State

#### 1. Documents Status (Last 24 Hours)
- **20 documents** uploaded at 23:12:51 UTC (approximately 1 hour ago)
- **All documents** are in "pending" status
- **No processing** has occurred due to lack of workers

#### 2. Redis State
- Connected successfully using username authentication
- Found 43 batch-related keys
- 3 batch progress keys (all stored as JSON strings, not hashes)
- No campaign_* keys found
- The specific campaign_205692f0_20250612_231117 does not exist

#### 3. Worker Status
- **NO CELERY WORKERS ARE RUNNING**
- This explains why documents remain unprocessed

### Key Issues Identified

#### Issue 1: Monitor.py Errors
The monitor application has three main errors:

1. **Supabase references**: Line 114 tries to access `self.supabase` which doesn't exist
2. **Wrong column name**: SQL query references `sd.processing_status` instead of `sd.status`
3. **Redis type mismatch**: Expects hash types but gets strings for batch:progress keys

**Fixed**: Column name issue has been corrected

#### Issue 2: Missing Campaign ID
The campaign_205692f0_20250612_231117 referenced in the error doesn't exist in Redis. The actual batch IDs found are:
- batch_e2ca1a03_20250612_231250
- batch_49de5849_20250612_231251
- batch_9be034e7_20250612_231249
- batch_ce667b58_20250612_231248

#### Issue 3: No Workers Running
No Celery workers are active, which means:
- Documents cannot be processed
- Batch jobs cannot execute
- The pipeline is effectively stopped

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Start Celery Workers**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/legal-doc-processor
   # Kill any stuck processes
   ps aux | grep "[c]elery" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r kill -9
   
   # Start workers for all queues
   celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --loglevel=info --queues=default,ocr,text,entity,graph,cleanup &
   
   # Start batch processing workers
   celery -A scripts.celery_app worker -Q batch.high -n batch-high@%h --concurrency=4 &
   celery -A scripts.celery_app worker -Q batch.normal -n batch-normal@%h --concurrency=2 &
   celery -A scripts.celery_app worker -Q batch.low -n batch-low@%h --concurrency=1 &
   ```

2. **Fix Monitor.py Completely**
   - Remove all Supabase references
   - Update batch progress reading to handle string types
   - Implement proper RDS queries for all monitoring functions

3. **Process Pending Documents**
   After starting workers, the 20 pending documents should begin processing automatically.

### Redis Batch Data Structure
The batch progress keys are stored as JSON strings with this structure:
```json
{
  "status": "processing",
  "priority": "high", 
  "total": 10,
  "completed": 0,
  "failed": 0,
  "started_at": "..."
}
```

### Next Steps
1. Start Celery workers immediately
2. Monitor document processing progress
3. Complete the monitor.py migration from Supabase to RDS
4. Investigate why the campaign ID format differs from batch IDs
5. Ensure batch submission scripts use consistent ID formats

All are waiting for worker processes to begin processing.
