# Context Update 167: OCR Processing Status and Remaining Issues

## Date: 2025-05-28

## Summary
After implementing CloudWatch logging and fixing the AWS region configuration, Textract is now successfully processing documents. However, there are remaining issues with the pipeline that need to be addressed.

## Current Status

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **AWS Region Mismatch**: Updated from `us-east-1` to `us-east-2` to match S3 bucket location
2. **S3 Access Permissions**: Bucket policy already allows Textract service principal
3. **File Path Resolution**: Monitor now uses S3 URIs when available
4. **CloudWatch Logging**: Implemented structured logging for Textract operations

### ⚠️ Partial Success
1. **Textract Processing**: Jobs are completing successfully
   - Job ID: `227349c8dad1172a024f095f5910db4be23cbdb5854a9fc9452e32b08db6d95d`
   - Status: `succeeded`
   - Processing time: 3.29 seconds
   - Text successfully extracted and stored

### ❌ Remaining Issues

1. **Pydantic Validation Error** in document display:
   ```
   ValidationError: 3 validation errors for CachedOCRResultModel
   metadata: Field required
   ocr_result: Field required
   file_hash: Field required
   ```

2. **Database Schema Issue**:
   ```
   column neo4j_entity_mentions.document_uuid does not exist
   ```

3. **Pipeline Continuation**: Despite successful OCR, the document is not progressing through the pipeline stages:
   - Document Node: Not created
   - Chunks: No chunks
   - Entity extraction: Not started

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Pydantic Model Mismatch
The `CachedOCRResultModel` expects different field names than what's being provided. This suggests a mismatch between the old caching logic and the new Pydantic models.

### 2. Schema Evolution
The `neo4j_entity_mentions` table appears to have a column name mismatch. It likely uses `documentId` instead of `document_uuid`.

### 3. Task Chain Interruption
The OCR task is completing but not triggering the next stage (document node creation). This could be due to:
- Error handling catching the Pydantic validation error
- Task result not being properly formed
- Missing task chain linkage

## Verification Data

**Document Status**:
- UUID: `1d4282be-6a1a-4c03-829d-8dfdce34828a`
- File: `Paul, Michael - JDH EOA 1-27-25.pdf`
- OCR Status: `ocr_failed` (despite Textract success)
- Textract Job Status: `succeeded`
- Raw text: Successfully extracted (verified in database)

**S3 Configuration**:
- Bucket: `samu-docs-private-upload`
- Region: `us-east-2`
- Key: `documents/1d4282be-6a1a-4c03-829d-8dfdce34828a.pdf`

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Pydantic Validation**:
   - Review `CachedOCRResultModel` in `scripts/core/cache_models.py`
   - Update field mappings in OCR caching logic
   - Ensure backward compatibility

2. **Fix Database Schema**:
   - Check actual column names in `neo4j_entity_mentions`
   - Update queries or apply migration as needed

3. **Ensure Task Chain Continuation**:
   - Add error recovery in OCR task
   - Verify task linking from OCR → Document Node creation
   - Add explicit success logging

4. **Monitor CloudWatch Logs**:
   - Check `/aws/textract/document-processing` log group
   - Look for any API errors or warnings
   - Analyze processing patterns

## CloudWatch Queries to Run

```sql
-- Check for Textract errors
SELECT * FROM '/aws/textract/document-processing'
WHERE event_type = 'job_start_failed'
  AND document_uuid = '1d4282be-6a1a-4c03-829d-8dfdce34828a'

-- Check processing flow
SELECT timestamp, event_type, job_id, metadata
FROM '/aws/textract/document-processing'
WHERE document_uuid = '1d4282be-6a1a-4c03-829d-8dfdce34828a'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Environment Variables**: Always verify AWS region settings match resource locations
2. **Error Messages**: "Unable to get object metadata" often indicates region mismatch
3. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration provides crucial visibility
4. **Schema Consistency**: Database column naming must be consistent across all queries
