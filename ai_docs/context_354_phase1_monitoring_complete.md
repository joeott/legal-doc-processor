# Context 354: Phase 1 Monitoring Complete

## Date: 2025-06-03

### Summary
Successfully completed Phase 1 of the supplemental implementation plan - fixing monitoring and visibility tools.

### Key Achievements

1. **Created Comprehensive Monitoring Tool**
   - `/opt/legal-doc-processor/scripts/monitor_document_complete.py`
   - Shows all 6 pipeline stages with visual indicators
   - Displays error messages and recent tasks
   - Works with correct column names

2. **Fixed All Column Name Issues**
   - Updated queries to use `document_id` instead of `document_uuid` for processing_tasks
   - Fixed relationship counting using JOIN through entity_mentions
   - Documented all mismatches in schema_reference.py

3. **Schema Reference Documentation**
   - Created `/opt/legal-doc-processor/scripts/utils/schema_reference.py`
   - Documents all column name discrepancies
   - Provides correct query patterns for common operations

### Column Name Discoveries
```
Key mismatches found and fixed:
- processing_tasks.document_id (NOT document_uuid)
- processing_tasks.celery_task_id (NOT task_id)
- source_documents.file_name (NOT filename)
- source_documents.textract_job_status (NOT ocr_status)
- document_chunks.text_content (NOT content)
- canonical_entities has NO direct document reference
- relationship_staging has NO document_uuid column
```

### Current Pipeline Status
For document 4909739b-8f12-40cd-8403-04b8b1a79281:
- ✓ Document Created
- ○ OCR pending
- ○ Chunks (0)
- ○ Entities (0)
- ○ Canonical (0)
- ○ Relationships (0)

### Next Steps - Phase 2
Now moving to Phase 2: Verify Pipeline Execution
1. Submit document to Celery pipeline
2. Monitor Textract job submission
3. Verify worker health
4. Check for any permission issues

### Monitoring Command
```bash
cd /opt/legal-doc-processor
source load_env.sh
python3 scripts/monitor_document_complete.py [document_uuid]
```

This tool will be essential for monitoring progress through the remaining phases.
