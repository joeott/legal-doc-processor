# End-to-End Processing Status Update

## Date: 2025-06-01

## Current Status

We are working to achieve end-to-end document processing for files in `/opt/legal-doc-processor/input_docs/`.

### What's Been Fixed

1. **Column Mapping**: Removed the need for column mapping - the database schema now matches what the code expects.

2. **Trigger Issues**: Fixed database triggers that were causing errors during updates.

3. **Import Corrections**: Updated `pdf_tasks.py` to use the original `ocr_extraction.py` instead of creating multiple versions.

4. **Task Chaining**: Fixed the Celery chain pattern to properly pass parameters between tasks (using synchronous calls with `.get()` instead of chain).

5. **Model Field Alignment**: Fixed PDFDocumentModel creation to use correct field names from SourceDocumentModel.

### Current Blockers

1. **Conformance Validation**: The system has conformance validation that detects 40 critical schema issues. This is blocking database operations.

2. **ProcessingStatus Enum**: There's a mismatch where the code is trying to use `ProcessingStatus.PROCESSING` but it's being stored as the string "PROCESSING" causing errors.

3. **Textract Integration**: The `ocr_extraction.py` expects to use TextractProcessor but the actual Textract processing is asynchronous and requires proper job management.

### Attempted Solutions

Initially created multiple script versions (ocr_simple.py, ocr_simple_v2.py, etc.) but per user directive, reverted to using only the original scripts and fixing them.

### Next Steps Required

1. **Resolve Conformance Issues**: Either fix the 40 schema issues or temporarily bypass conformance validation for testing.

2. **Fix ProcessingStatus Usage**: Ensure ProcessingStatus enum values are properly serialized/deserialized.

3. **Complete OCR Implementation**: The original ocr_extraction.py needs to properly handle async Textract jobs.

4. **Test End-to-End**: Once OCR works, test the complete pipeline through all stages.

## Code Locations

- Main task definitions: `/opt/legal-doc-processor/scripts/pdf_tasks.py`
- OCR extraction: `/opt/legal-doc-processor/scripts/ocr_extraction.py`
- Textract utilities: `/opt/legal-doc-processor/scripts/textract_utils.py`
- Database manager: `/opt/legal-doc-processor/scripts/db.py`
- Test document UUID: `0697af52-8bc6-4299-90ec-5d67b7eeb858`

## Test Command

```bash
cd /opt/legal-doc-processor
python3 scripts/clear_doc_cache.py
python3 scripts/reset_and_test.py
```

## Current Error

The pipeline fails at OCR extraction due to:
1. Conformance validation detecting schema issues
2. ProcessingStatus enum handling issues
3. Textract async job management not fully implemented
