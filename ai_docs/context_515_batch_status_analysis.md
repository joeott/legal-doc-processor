# Context 515: Paul Michael Acuity Batch Status Analysis

Generated: 2025-06-12

## Executive Summary

Analysis of the Paul Michael Acuity batch (project_fk_id = 18) reveals significant processing issues:

- **Total Documents**: 20 (appears to be duplicates - 10 unique documents uploaded twice)
- **Completed**: 0 documents (0%)
- **In Progress**: 7 documents (35%) - all stuck after Entity Resolution
- **Not Started**: 13 documents (65%) - no processing tasks found

## Key Findings

### 1. Document Duplication
The batch contains 20 documents, but these appear to be 10 unique documents uploaded twice:
- First set: Uploaded at 2025-06-12 02:09:45 - 02:09:57
- Second set: Uploaded at 2025-06-12 02:10:42 - 02:10:51

### 2. Processing Pipeline Status

#### Documents with Processing (7 documents):
All 7 documents that started processing have:
- ❌ **OCR Extraction**: Not started
- ❌ **Text Chunking**: Not started  
- ✅ **Entity Extraction**: Completed (11.7s - 99.5s)
- ✅ **Entity Resolution**: Completed (0.1s - 0.3s)
- ❌ **Relationship Extraction**: Not started
- ❌ **Finalization**: Not started

**Critical Issue**: These documents skipped OCR and chunking, jumping directly to entity extraction. This explains why they're stuck - entity extraction likely worked on existing chunks from previous runs, but without proper OCR/chunking, the pipeline cannot continue.

#### Documents Not Started (13 documents):
- No processing tasks found in the database
- Status remains "pending"
- All have valid S3 locations

### 3. Data Extraction Results

For the 7 documents that partially processed:
- Chunks created: 4-23 per document
- Entity mentions: 16-114 per document
- Canonical entities: 11-61 per document
- Relationships: 0 (stage never reached)

### 4. Document Details

#### Successfully Extracted Entities (but stuck):
1. **Paul, Michael - Lora Prop Disclosure Stmt**: 16 entities, 11 canonical
2. **Plaintiff Acuity Amend Disclosure Stmt**: 16 entities, 12 canonical
3. **Plaintiff Acuity Disclosure Stmt**: 27 entities, 22 canonical
4. **Riverdale Disclosure Stmt**: 19 entities, 13 canonical
5. **Wombat Corp Disclosure Stmt**: 32 entities, 17 canonical
6. **Amended complaint**: 96 entities, 35 canonical
7. **Initial Disclosures**: 114 entities, 61 canonical

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Pipeline Start Failure**: The OCR extraction stage never triggered for any document
2. **Orphaned Processing**: Entity extraction somehow ran without OCR/chunking completing first
3. **Queue Issues**: Possible Celery queue configuration problem preventing OCR tasks from being picked up
4. **Worker Configuration**: OCR workers may not be running or not configured for the correct queue

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Check Celery worker status for OCR queue
2. Verify OCR task submission logic in the pipeline
3. Clear stuck documents and restart processing
4. Monitor queue depths to ensure tasks are being consumed

### Pipeline Fixes Needed:
1. Add validation to prevent entity extraction without completed OCR/chunking
2. Implement proper task dependencies in Celery
3. Add timeout and retry logic for stuck stages
4. Improve error reporting for failed task submissions

### Recovery Plan:
1. Reset all 20 documents to "pending" status
2. Clear any orphaned processing tasks
3. Restart Celery workers with proper queue configuration
4. Resubmit documents through proper intake process
5. Monitor each stage completion before proceeding

## Conclusion

The Paul Michael Acuity batch has not successfully processed any documents to completion. The primary issue is that OCR extraction never started, causing all documents to either remain unprocessed or get stuck after entity resolution. This indicates a fundamental issue with the pipeline initialization or queue configuration that must be addressed before reprocessing.
