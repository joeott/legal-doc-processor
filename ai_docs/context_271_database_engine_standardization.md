# Context 271: Database Engine Standardization and Error Fixes

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Overview

This commit addresses several critical issues preventing successful document processing in the Celery pipeline. The changes were implemented by Jules, another agentic coder, to resolve database connectivity and validation errors.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Standardize Database Engine Initialization

**Problem**: Multiple database engine configurations were causing inconsistencies and connection issues.

**Solution**:
- Centralized SQLAlchemy engine creation in `scripts/config.py`, using `get_database_url()` for consistent URL determination
- Modified `scripts/db.py` and `scripts/rds_utils.py` to use this single, shared engine and session factory
- Ensured `load_dotenv` is called early in `config.py` to load `scripts/.env`

**Impact**: This resolves potential inconsistencies from multiple engine configurations and ensures all components use the same database connection parameters.

### 2. Fix ConformanceReport Attribute Error

**Problem**: An AttributeError occurred in `scripts/core/conformance_validator.py` where `report.validation_results` was accessed incorrectly.

**Solution**:
- Corrected the attribute access error
- The code now calculates a `total_fields_checked_count` based on model definitions for the `fields_validated` metric in `ValidationMetrics`

**Impact**: Prevents crashes during conformance validation and provides accurate validation metrics.

### 3. Improve DatabaseManager.validate_conformance Error Handling

**Problem**: Insufficient error handling was causing failures to be masked or improperly handled.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced exception handling in `DatabaseManager.validate_conformance` (in `scripts/db.py`)
- Now distinguishes between:
  - `ImportError`: Allows degraded mode (as per original design)
  - `ConformanceError`: Schema validation failure
  - Other unexpected exceptions
- Unexpected exceptions during validation will now be re-raised after logging
- `conformance_validated` will be correctly set to `False`, preventing tasks from proceeding with a potentially broken DB manager

**Impact**: More robust error handling and clearer failure modes when database validation fails.

### 4. Add Logging for Database URL in Celery Workers

**Problem**: Difficult to diagnose database connection issues in Celery workers.

**Solution**:
- Added logging statements in `PDFTask` (in `scripts/pdf_tasks.py`) to output:
  - The raw `DATABASE_URL` from the environment
  - The effective URL determined by `config.get_database_url()`

**Impact**: Aids in verifying Celery worker environment configurations and debugging connection issues.

## Critical Deployment Guidance

**Primary Issue**: The "Document not found in database" error in Celery tasks is likely caused by workers not having the correct `DATABASE_URL`.

**Required Action**: 
- Ensure the Supervisor (or other process manager) configuration for Celery workers explicitly sets the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the direct RDS connection string
- Also set related environment variables:
  - `DEPLOYMENT_STAGE`
  - `USE_DIRECT_DATABASE_CONNECTION`

## File Changes Summary

1. **scripts/config.py**: 
   - Added centralized database engine initialization
   - Early `load_dotenv` call
   - Consistent URL determination logic

2. **scripts/core/conformance_validator.py**:
   - Fixed attribute access error
   - Added proper field counting logic

3. **scripts/db.py**:
   - Refactored to use shared engine from config
   - Improved error handling in validate_conformance
   - Better distinction between error types

4. **scripts/pdf_tasks.py**:
   - Added database URL logging
   - Helps debug worker environment issues

5. **scripts/rds_utils.py**:
   - Simplified to use shared engine from config
   - Removed duplicate engine creation logic

## Next Steps

1. Verify Celery worker environment configuration
2. Ensure all environment variables are properly set in Supervisor config
3. Test document processing with the updated codebase
4. Monitor logs for database URL confirmation in workers
