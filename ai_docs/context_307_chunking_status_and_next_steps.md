# Context 307: Chunking Status and Next Steps

## Current Situation

### What's Working
1. **Database Visibility**: Fixed - Celery workers can now see documents created by test scripts
2. **AWS Credentials**: Fixed - Workers have proper AWS credentials via environment wrapper
3. **Textract Job Submission**: Working - Successfully submitting jobs and getting job IDs
4. **Job ID Persistence**: Fixed - Job IDs now persist to database correctly
5. **OCR Text Extraction**: Working - Successfully extracting 3,278 characters from test document
6. **Text Persistence**: Fixed - OCR text now persists to both Redis cache AND database
7. **Column Mapping**: Fixed - Changed mapping from `text_content` to `text` to match database schema
8. **Chunk Creation**: Partially working - 1 chunk was created in the database

### What's Not Working
1. **Chunking Logic**: Only creating 1 chunk instead of multiple chunks for a 3,278 character document
   - Expected: With chunk_size=1000 and overlap=200, should create 4-5 chunks
   - Actual: Only 1 chunk created
   - Likely issue: The chunking algorithm may be returning the entire text as a single chunk

### Key Fixes Applied
1. **Database Visibility** (context_299-300):
   ```python
   # Added retry logic with direct SQL queries
   session = DBSessionLocal()
   result = session.execute(
       text("SELECT 1 FROM source_documents WHERE document_uuid = :uuid"),
       {"uuid": str(document_uuid)}
   )
   ```

2. **AWS Credentials** (context_301):
   ```bash
   # Created celery_worker_env.sh wrapper
   #!/bin/bash
   source /opt/legal-doc-processor/load_env.sh
   exec "$@"
   ```

3. **Job ID Persistence** (context_302):
   ```python
   # Fixed session management in textract_job_manager.py
   session = next(db_manager.get_session())
   try:
       # operations
   finally:
       session.close()
   ```

4. **Text Persistence** (context_303-304):
   ```python
   # Added database update in poll_textract_job
   session.execute(update_query, {
       'text': result['text'],
       'doc_uuid': str(document_uuid)
   })
   session.commit()
   ```

5. **Column Mapping** (context_305-306):
   ```python
   # In enhanced_column_mappings.py
   "text": "text",  # Direct mapping
   "text_content": "text",  # Map text_content to text column
   
   # In models_minimal.py
   text: str  # Changed from text_content
   ```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Fix Chunking Algorithm**:
   - Check `scripts/chunking_utils.py` - the `simple_chunk_text` function
   - Verify it's actually splitting text into multiple chunks
   - Add logging to see what chunks are being generated

2. **Debug Chunk Creation**:
   - Add detailed logging in `chunk_document_text` task
   - Log the number of chunks returned by `simple_chunk_text`
   - Log each chunk being processed

3. **Verify Entity Extraction**:
   - Once chunking is fixed, verify entity extraction works
   - Check if entities are being extracted from chunks
   - Verify entity persistence

4. **Complete Pipeline**:
   - Entity resolution stage
   - Relationship building stage
   - Pipeline finalization

### Code Investigation Points

1. **chunking_utils.py**:
   ```python
   # Need to verify this function is working correctly
   chunks = simple_chunk_text(text, chunk_size, overlap)
   ```

2. **pdf_tasks.py** (lines 446-450):
   ```python
   chunks = simple_chunk_text(text, chunk_size, overlap)
   
   if not chunks:
       raise ValueError("No chunks generated from text")
   ```

3. **Chunk Model Creation** (lines 456-479):
   - Verify the loop is iterating over multiple chunks
   - Check if all chunks are being stored

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check chunking function directly
python -c "
from scripts.chunking_utils import simple_chunk_text
text = 'a' * 3278  # Simulate document text
chunks = simple_chunk_text(text, 1000, 200)
print(f'Generated {len(chunks)} chunks')
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks[:3]):
    print(f'Chunk {i}: {len(chunk)} chars')
"

# Check what's in the chunks table
python -c "
from scripts.db import DatabaseManager
from sqlalchemy import text
db = DatabaseManager(validate_conformance=False)
session = next(db.get_session())
result = session.execute(text('SELECT * FROM document_chunks WHERE document_uuid = :uuid'), {'uuid': '5805f7b5-09ca-4f95-a990-da2dd758fd9e'})
for row in result:
    print(f'Chunk {row.chunk_index}: text_length={len(row.text) if row.text else 0}')
session.close()
"
```

## Summary

The pipeline has made significant progress:
- ✅ Database visibility issues resolved
- ✅ AWS credentials working
- ✅ Textract OCR completing successfully
- ✅ Text persisting to database
- ✅ Column mapping issues fixed
- ⚠️ Chunking creating only 1 chunk instead of multiple
- ❌ Entity extraction not yet tested
- ❌ Entity resolution not yet tested
- ❌ Relationship building not yet tested

The critical blocker is now the chunking algorithm only creating a single chunk. This needs to be investigated and fixed before the pipeline can complete successfully.
