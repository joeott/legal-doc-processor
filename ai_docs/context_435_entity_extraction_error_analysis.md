# Entity Extraction Error Analysis

## Date: June 6, 2025

## Summary
Analysis of entity extraction failures in the Celery log reveals a consistent pattern of OpenAI API quota errors preventing entity extraction from proceeding.

## Key Findings

### 1. OpenAI API Quota Exceeded (Error 429)
All entity extraction attempts are failing with the same error:
```
ERROR:scripts.entity_service:OpenAI entity extraction failed: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', 'param': None, 'code': 'insufficient_quota'}}
```

### 2. Retry Pattern
The OpenAI client attempts to retry 3 times before giving up:
- Initial request: HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
- Retry 1: After ~0.4-0.5 seconds
- Retry 2: After ~0.8-0.9 seconds
- Final failure: Returns insufficient_quota error

### 3. Task Completion Despite Errors
All entity extraction tasks are marked as "succeeded" but with empty results:
```
Task scripts.pdf_tasks.extract_entities_from_chunks[...] succeeded in X.XXs: {'entity_mentions': [], 'canonical_entities': []}
```

### 4. Affected Documents
Multiple documents are affected, with entity extraction attempts for numerous chunks all failing with the same pattern:
- Document UUIDs: 7258dc67-90db-479c-9177-a2c01c5c97c8, and others
- Each document has multiple chunks (typically 10-15 chunks per document)
- Every chunk extraction attempt results in 0 entities extracted

### 5. Failure Mode
The system gracefully handles the OpenAI failures:
1. OpenAI API returns 429 error
2. Entity service logs the error
3. Returns empty list of entities (0 entities)
4. Task completes "successfully" with empty results
5. Pipeline continues to next stage (entity resolution)

## Root Cause
The OpenAI account associated with the API key has exceeded its usage quota. This is preventing any entity extraction from occurring.

## Impact
- No entities are being extracted from any documents
- Entity resolution stage receives empty entity lists
- Relationship building has no entities to work with
- The entire knowledge graph extraction is non-functional

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Check OpenAI account billing and usage limits
2. **Short-term**: Add quota to the OpenAI account or use a different API key
3. **Medium-term**: Implement fallback entity extraction methods (local NER models)
4. **Long-term**: Add monitoring and alerting for API quota issues

## Additional Observations
- The system is configured for Stage 1 deployment (cloud-only with OpenAI)
- No fallback mechanism is currently active when OpenAI fails
- The error handling is working correctly - tasks don't fail catastrophically
- All tasks complete within reasonable timeframes (7-22 seconds) despite the errors
