# Context 41: Initial Processing Status Error - Fix Summary

## Problem Solved âœ…

**Error**: `{'message': 'record "new" has no field "initial_processing_status"', 'code': '42703'}`

**Root Cause**: Database triggers were trying to access a column `initial_processing_status` that didn't exist in the `document_processing_queue` table.

## The Fix That Worked

### Solution: Computed Column with Safe Triggers

Instead of adding a physical column or trying to fix complex legacy triggers, we implemented a **computed column** solution that provides backward compatibility while maintaining a clean schema.

### Key Components of the Fix:

#### 1. Added Computed Column to `document_processing_queue`
```sql
ALTER TABLE document_processing_queue 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS initial_processing_status TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    CASE 
        WHEN status = 'pending' THEN 'pending_intake'
        WHEN status = 'processing' THEN 'processing'
        WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 'completed'
        WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 'error'
        ELSE status
    END
) STORED;
```

**Why This Works**: 
- The column is automatically computed from the existing `status` column
- No application code changes needed
- Triggers can now reference `initial_processing_status` without errors
- Maintains consistency between old and new column naming conventions

#### 2. Removed Problematic Triggers
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS queue_status_change_trigger ON document_processing_queue CASCADE;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_update_queue_status ON document_processing_queue CASCADE;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_queue_on_completion ON document_processing_queue CASCADE;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS document_status_change_trigger ON document_processing_queue CASCADE;
```

**Why Necessary**: These triggers were the source of the error, trying to access non-existent columns.

#### 3. Created Safe, Schema-Aware Triggers
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER sync_queue_on_document_update
    AFTER UPDATE ON source_documents
    FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN (
        (NEW.initial_processing_status = 'completed' OR
         NEW.initial_processing_status LIKE 'error%') AND
        OLD.initial_processing_status IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.initial_processing_status
    )
    EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_queue_status_from_document();
```

**Key Insight**: The trigger is on `source_documents` (which HAS `initial_processing_status`) not on `document_processing_queue`.

## Migration Details

- **File**: `/frontend/migrations/00002_fix_queue_triggers.sql`
- **Applied**: Successfully via Supabase MCP tool
- **Verification**: Queue updates now work without errors

## Technical Explanation

The error occurred because:
1. Legacy triggers assumed `document_processing_queue` had an `initial_processing_status` column
2. The actual column was only on `source_documents` table
3. Any UPDATE to the queue table triggered the error

The fix works because:
1. We added the expected column as a computed field
2. We removed triggers that were on the wrong table
3. We created proper triggers that respect the actual schema

## Business Impact

- **Immediate**: Queue processor can now claim and process documents
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead from computed column
- **Maintenance**: Clear separation between queue status and document status
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing application code

## Lessons Learned

1. **Computed columns** are an excellent solution for schema evolution issues
2. **Trigger placement matters** - they must be on the correct table
3. **Schema assumptions** in triggers can cause hidden failures
4. **Backward compatibility** can be achieved without major refactoring

This fix successfully unblocked the Stage 1 pipeline while maintaining system integrity.
