# Context 355: Phase 2 Pipeline Execution Findings

## Date: 2025-06-03

### Summary
Started Phase 2 - Verify Pipeline Execution. Successfully submitted document to Celery pipeline but discovered issues with worker processing.

### Key Findings

1. **Task Submission Success**
   - Initial submission failed due to signature mismatch
   - process_pdf_document requires: document_uuid, file_path, project_uuid
   - Successfully submitted with correct parameters
   - Task ID: 6645ade3-3e23-450a-bce5-9cf9e2b053fc
   - Status: SUCCESS
   - OCR task spawned: 5aa0fe6f-918f-4943-a283-fa1b313a316a

2. **Worker Configuration Issues**
   - Supervisor configured workers are in FATAL state
   - Looking for non-existent file: `/opt/legal-doc-processor/scripts/celery_worker_env.sh`
   - However, workers ARE running (visible in ps output)
   - Workers were likely started manually

3. **OCR Processing Status**
   - OCR task remains in PENDING state
   - No Textract job ID recorded in database
   - Document still shows "Textract: Not started"
   - No error messages in logs

4. **Potential Issues Identified**
   - Workers may not be configured for OCR queue
   - Textract permissions may need verification
   - Region configuration might be an issue
   - Worker logs are not easily accessible

### Current Pipeline Status
```
Document: Paul, Michael - Wombat Corp Disclosure Stmt 10-23-24.pdf
UUID: 4909739b-8f12-40cd-8403-04b8b1a79281
Pipeline Progress:
  1. Document Created: ✓
  2. OCR: ○ pending (task created but not processing)
  3. Chunks: ○ (0)
  4. Entities: ○ (0)
  5. Canonical: ○ (0)
  6. Relationships: ○ (0)
```

### Next Steps for Phase 2
1. Check worker queue configuration
2. Verify Textract IAM permissions
3. Test Textract directly with proper error handling
4. Check if workers are consuming from OCR queue
5. Enable more verbose logging

### Worker Status
```bash
# Workers are running
ps aux | grep celery
ubuntu 290034 /usr/bin/python3 -m celery -A scripts.celery_app worker
ubuntu 290052 /usr/bin/python3 -m celery -A scripts.celery_app worker
ubuntu 290063 /usr/bin/python3 -m celery -A scripts.celery_app worker
```

### Commands Used
```bash
# Submit task correctly
from scripts.pdf_tasks import process_pdf_document
result = process_pdf_document.delay(
    document_uuid='4909739b-8f12-40cd-8403-04b8b1a79281',
    file_path='input_docs/Paul, Michael (Acuity)/Paul, Michael - Wombat Corp Disclosure Stmt 10-23-24.pdf',
    project_uuid='e0c57112-c755-4798-bc1f-4ecc3f0eec78'
)
```

### Recommendation
Need to investigate why the OCR task is not being picked up by workers. This could be:
1. Queue routing issue
2. Worker not listening to correct queue
3. Task serialization problem
4. AWS permissions issue

Phase 3 (Textract permissions) may need to be done in parallel with resolving the worker issue.
