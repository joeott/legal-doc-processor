# Context 109: Celery Migration Phase 3 Complete

## Summary of Phase 3 Implementation

Successfully enhanced all Celery tasks with explicit state management and task chaining as specified in context_108_redis_celery_implement_enforce.md.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced OCR Tasks (`scripts/celery_tasks/ocr_tasks.py`)
- ✅ Added `celery_status` updates in source_documents table at task start
- ✅ Added `celery_status` updates on successful completion
- ✅ Added `celery_status` updates on task failure
- ✅ Task already chains to `create_document_node` in text_tasks.py

### 2. Enhanced Text Tasks (`scripts/celery_tasks/text_tasks.py`)
- ✅ Updated `create_document_node` to update celery_status to 'text_processing' at start
- ✅ Updated to set celery_status to 'text_failed' on error
- ✅ Modified `process_chunking` to accept source_doc_sql_id parameter
- ✅ Task chains properly pass source_doc_sql_id through to entity extraction

### 3. Enhanced Entity Tasks (`scripts/celery_tasks/entity_tasks.py`)
- ✅ Modified `extract_entities` to accept source_doc_sql_id parameter
- ✅ Added celery_status update to 'entity_extraction' at start
- ✅ Added celery_status update to 'entity_failed' on error
- ✅ Modified `resolve_entities` to accept source_doc_sql_id parameter
- ✅ Added celery_status update to 'entity_resolution' at start
- ✅ Added celery_status update to 'resolution_failed' on error
- ✅ Both tasks chain properly to next stages with source_doc_sql_id

### 4. Enhanced Graph Tasks (`scripts/celery_tasks/graph_tasks.py`)
- ✅ Modified `build_relationships` to accept source_doc_sql_id parameter
- ✅ Added celery_status update to 'graph_building' at start
- ✅ Added celery_status update to 'completed' on successful completion
- ✅ Added celery_status update to 'graph_failed' on error

## Key Implementation Details

### Status Flow in source_documents.celery_status:
1. `pending` → Initial state when document created
2. `processing` → When submitted to Celery
3. `ocr_processing` → OCR task started
4. `ocr_complete` → OCR finished successfully
5. `text_processing` → Text processing/chunking started
6. `entity_extraction` → Entity extraction started
7. `entity_resolution` → Entity resolution started
8. `graph_building` → Relationship building started
9. `completed` → All processing finished successfully

### Error States:
- `ocr_failed` → OCR task failed
- `text_failed` → Text processing failed
- `entity_failed` → Entity extraction failed
- `resolution_failed` → Entity resolution failed
- `graph_failed` → Graph building failed

### Verification Script Created
Created `scripts/verify_celery_tasks.py` to test:
- Celery workers are running
- Status updates flow correctly through pipeline
- Redis state tracking works
- All expected status transitions occur

## Next Steps (Remaining Phases)

### Phase 4: Remove Supabase Queue Dependencies (30 min)
- Comment out deprecated queue methods in supabase_utils.py
- Update configuration to remove queue polling settings
- Add DOCUMENT_INTAKE_DIR configuration

### Phase 5: Update Monitoring (30 min)
- Update pipeline monitor to show Celery status instead of queue status
- Update health checks to monitor Redis/Celery queues
- Remove references to document_processing_queue

### Phase 6: Testing & Verification (45 min)
- Run verify_celery_tasks.py to confirm status updates work
- Run integration tests for full workflow
- Verify no new entries in document_processing_queue

### Phase 7: Deployment (15 min)
- Stop old queue processor services
- Start Celery workers (if not running)
- Monitor transition with pipeline monitor

## Critical Achievement

The core achievement of Phase 3 is that **all Celery tasks now explicitly update the celery_status field in source_documents**, providing complete visibility into document processing state without relying on database triggers or the deprecated queue table.

This ensures:
1. Full traceability of document processing
2. Ability to monitor progress via source_documents table
3. Clear error states for debugging
4. Proper task chaining with status handoffs
5. Redis state tracking for real-time monitoring

The implementation follows the exact specifications in context_108 while maintaining compatibility with existing code patterns.
