## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Complete Priority 1 tasks to achieve basic conformance
2. **Week 2**: Implement Priority 2 Redis optimizations
3. **Week 3**: Execute Priority 3 full pipeline testing
4. **Week 4**: Deploy Priority 4 monitoring enhancements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All testing checklist items from context_114 pass
- [ ] Redis caching reduces DB queries by >60%
- [ ] Reprocessing works without manual intervention
- [ ] Processing time improves by >40% with cache hits
- [ ] Zero duplicate key constraint violations
- [ ] Full document processes end-to-end successfully
- [ ] Monitoring shows real-time cache utilization

## Technical Notes

### Cache Key Naming Convention
```
doc:{data_type}:{document_uuid}[:v{version}]
```

### TTL Recommendations
- OCR Results: 7 days (expensive to recompute)
- Chunks/Mentions: 2 days (intermediate data)
- Canonical Entities: 3 days (frequently accessed)
- Processing State: 7 days (debugging/monitoring)
- Locks: 10 minutes (prevent deadlocks)

### Redis Memory Estimation
- Average document OCR: ~50KB
- Chunk list: ~2KB
- Entity mentions: ~20KB
- Canonical entities: ~10KB
- Total per document: ~85KB
- 10,000 documents: ~850MB Redis memory

## Conclusion

This comprehensive task list addresses both the immediate conformance issues and the longer-term optimization goals. By implementing these changes systematically, the pipeline will achieve full functionality while significantly improving performance through intelligent Redis caching.
