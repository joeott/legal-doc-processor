# Context 323: Resolution Mechanism and Verification

## Problem Summary

The canonical entity persistence issue was caused by a fundamental incompatibility between:
- The `EntityService` class expecting entity mentions to have a `.text` attribute
- The `EntityMentionMinimal` models having `.entity_text` instead
- The `PDFTask` base class initializing `EntityService` which caused failures even before resolution logic ran

## Solution Implemented: Separate Resolution Task

### 1. Created Standalone Resolution Task (`scripts/resolution_task.py`)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Created `SimpleResolutionTask` class that inherits from Celery's base `Task` instead of `PDFTask`
- Avoids EntityService initialization entirely
- Uses proven `entity_resolution_fixes.py` functions directly
- Handles both cached and database-sourced entity mentions

**Task Flow:**
```python
@app.task(bind=True, base=SimpleResolutionTask, queue='entity')
def resolve_entities_standalone(self, document_uuid: str, entity_mentions: List[Dict[str, Any]] = None)
```

### 2. Key Features of the New Task

1. **Flexible Input Handling**:
   - Can receive entity mentions as parameters (from entity extraction)
   - Can load from Redis cache if not provided
   - Can load from database as fallback

2. **Database Persistence**:
   - Saves entity mentions to database if not already present
   - Saves canonical entities using `save_canonical_entities_to_db`
   - Updates entity mentions with canonical UUIDs

3. **Proper Pipeline Continuation**:
   - Loads all required data (chunks, metadata, project UUID)
   - Triggers `build_document_relationships` with complete data
   - Includes document_uuid in metadata to prevent downstream errors

### 3. Integration Changes

**Updated Entity Extraction** (`scripts/pdf_tasks.py`):
```python
# Old:
resolve_document_entities.apply_async(args=[document_uuid, entity_mentions_data])

# New:
from scripts.resolution_task import resolve_entities_standalone
resolve_entities_standalone.apply_async(args=[document_uuid, entity_mentions_data])
```

**Updated Celery Configuration** (`scripts/celery_app.py`):
```python
include=[
    'scripts.pdf_tasks',
    'scripts.resolution_task'  # Added new module
]

task_routes={
    # ...
    'scripts.resolution_task.resolve_entities_standalone': {'queue': 'entity'},
    # ...
}
```

## Verification Results

### Test Execution
```bash
python3 test_new_resolution.py
```

### Results:
- **Task Status**: ✅ Completed successfully
- **Canonical Entities Created**: 7 (from 8 mentions)
- **Deduplication Rate**: 12.5%
- **Entity Resolution Examples**:
  - "Wombat" + "Wombat Acquisitions, LLC" → "Wombat Acquisitions, LLC" (2 mentions)
  - Other entities remained distinct (1 mention each)

### Database Verification:
```sql
-- All canonical entities properly saved:
ORG: Wombat Acquisitions, LLC (2 mentions)
DATE: 10/23/24 (1 mentions)
ORG: Acuity, A Mutual Insurance Company (1 mentions)
ORG: EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI (1 mentions)
PERSON: Lora (1 mentions)
ORG: Riverdale Packaging Corporation (1 mentions)
ORG: UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT (1 mentions)
```

### Pipeline State Verification:
- `entity_resolution`: **completed** ✅
- All data properly persisted to PostgreSQL
- Redis cache updated with canonical entities

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Bypasses EntityService Completely**: No attribute mismatch issues
2. **Uses Proven Code**: The `entity_resolution_fixes.py` functions work perfectly
3. **Maintains Data Integrity**: Ensures entities are saved to database before resolution
4. **Proper Task Isolation**: Each task has clear inputs/outputs
5. **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing entity extraction output

## Next Steps

With entity resolution now working reliably, the pipeline should be tested end-to-end to ensure:
1. Relationship building receives the canonical entities correctly
2. Pipeline completion is triggered after all stages
3. All stages achieve the target 99% success rate

## Technical Notes

- The standalone task approach can be applied to other problematic stages if needed
- This demonstrates the value of loose coupling between pipeline stages
- The solution maintains idempotency - can be safely retried
