# Context 294: Region Fix Complete - Testing Status and Next Steps

## Executive Summary
We have successfully implemented the S3-Textract region fix that resolves the critical cross-region access issue. The fix is deployed and ready for testing, but we encountered execution issues during the verification phase. This document provides complete context for resuming work.

## Critical Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: S3 bucket `samu-docs-private-upload` is in `us-east-2`, but Textract was using `us-east-1`
- **Solution**: Added `S3_BUCKET_REGION` configuration that ensures all S3 and Textract operations use the same region
- **Status**: Fix is implemented in codebase but needs testing verification

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Region Configuration Fix (COMPLETE)
Modified the following files to use `S3_BUCKET_REGION`:
- `scripts/config.py`: Added `S3_BUCKET_REGION = os.getenv('S3_BUCKET_REGION', 'us-east-2')`
- `scripts/s3_storage.py`: S3 client now uses `S3_BUCKET_REGION`
- `scripts/textract_utils.py`: Textract client now uses `S3_BUCKET_REGION`
- `scripts/textract_job_manager.py`: Job manager now uses `S3_BUCKET_REGION`

### 2. Test Scripts Created
- `/opt/legal-doc-processor/scripts/full_pipeline_test.py` - Comprehensive E2E test
- `/opt/legal-doc-processor/scripts/test_region_fix_complete.py` - Region-specific test
- Both scripts set `os.environ['S3_BUCKET_REGION'] = 'us-east-2'` before imports

### 3. Initial Test Results
- Document successfully uploaded to S3: `s3://samu-docs-private-upload/documents/7343e313-11a3-4070-924d-8a1a84cc31c1.pdf`
- Database record created with UUID: `7343e313-11a3-4070-924d-8a1a84cc31c1`
- OCR task submitted: Task ID `b4a884a0-3c88-4758-9130-0babef0b46e1`
- Task failed with: "Document 7343e313-11a3-4070-924d-8a1a84cc31c1 not found in database"

## Current Status and Blockers

### 1. Database Connection Issue
The Celery worker appears to be using a different database connection than the test script:
- Test script successfully creates document in database
- Celery worker cannot find the same document
- This suggests a database connection configuration mismatch

### 2. Environment Configuration
Current settings that are working:
```bash
USE_MINIMAL_MODELS=true
SKIP_CONFORMANCE_CHECK=true
S3_BUCKET_REGION=us-east-2
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://app_user:LegalDoc2025%5C%21Secure@database1.cuviucyodbeg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/legal_doc_processing?sslmode=require
```

### 3. System State
- Celery workers are running (1 worker with 6 queues)
- Redis is connected and functional
- S3 uploads are working correctly with region fix
- Database writes from test scripts are successful
- Pipeline tasks are registered in Celery

## Immediate Next Steps (For Resume)

### 1. Verify Celery Database Connection
```bash
# Check what database URL Celery workers are using
cd /opt/legal-doc-processor && source load_env.sh
python3 -c "from scripts.celery_app import app; from scripts.config import DATABASE_URL; print(f'Celery DB: {DATABASE_URL}')"
```

### 2. Run Region Fix Test with PYTHONPATH
```bash
cd /opt/legal-doc-processor && source load_env.sh
PYTHONPATH=/opt/legal-doc-processor:$PYTHONPATH python3 scripts/test_region_fix_complete.py
```

### 3. Check Worker Logs
Look for actual Celery worker logs (location TBD):
- Check systemd logs: `sudo journalctl -u celery -n 100`
- Check supervisor logs if using supervisor
- Look for custom log location in worker startup

### 4. Manual Task Test
If automated test fails, manually verify the pipeline:
```python
# 1. Create document in DB
# 2. Verify it exists
# 3. Submit OCR task with explicit database session
# 4. Monitor Textract job creation
```

## Key Test Document
Using: `/opt/legal-doc-processor/input_docs/Paul, Michael (Acuity)/Paul, Michael - Wombat Corp Disclosure Stmt 10-23-24.pdf`
- This is a valid PDF that exists on disk
- Has been successfully uploaded to S3 multiple times
- Project UUID for testing: `e0c57112-c755-4798-bc1f-4ecc3f0eec78`

## Success Criteria
The pipeline is working when:
1. Document uploads to S3 with correct region
2. Textract job starts without region errors
3. OCR completes and text is extracted
4. Pipeline automatically progresses through:
   - OCR → Chunking → Entity Extraction → Entity Resolution → Relationships
5. All stages show "completed" status
6. Document chunks are created in database
7. Entities are extracted and stored

## Important Context Files
Review these for background:
- `ai_docs/context_290_textract_region_fix.md` - Details of the region fix implementation
- `ai_docs/context_289_phase_4_test_results.md` - Previous testing phase results
- `ai_docs/context_293_s3_textract_permissions_fix.md` - S3 bucket policy that was applied

## Database Schema Notes
Key tables and their status columns:
- `source_documents`: Uses `status`, `celery_status`, `textract_job_status` (NOT `processing_status`)
- `processing_tasks`: Uses `document_id` (NOT `document_uuid`), `celery_task_id`, `status`
- `document_chunks`: Linked by `document_uuid`
- `entity_mentions`: Linked by `document_uuid`

## Final Notes
- The region fix is correctly implemented in the codebase
- S3 and Textract are now using the same region (us-east-2)
- The main blocker appears to be Celery workers not finding documents created by test scripts
- This is likely a database connection or transaction isolation issue
- Once this is resolved, the full pipeline should work with the region fix

## Resume Command
To immediately resume testing:
```bash
cd /opt/legal-doc-processor && \
source load_env.sh && \
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/legal-doc-processor:$PYTHONPATH && \
export S3_BUCKET_REGION=us-east-2 && \
python3 scripts/test_region_fix_complete.py
```

This will test the complete pipeline with proper region configuration and should reveal whether the region fix has fully resolved the S3-Textract access issues.
