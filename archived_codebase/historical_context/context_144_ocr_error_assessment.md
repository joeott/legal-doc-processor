# Context 144: OCR Error Assessment - Widespread Processing Failures

## Executive Summary

A critical environment configuration mismatch has caused 463 out of 464 documents (99.8%) to fail during OCR processing. The root cause is that Celery workers are using an incorrect Supabase instance URL from the system environment instead of the updated .env file configuration.

## Evidence of the Problem

### 1. Scale of Failures (MCP Query Results)

```json
// Redis Pipeline Metrics Query Results
{
  "pipeline_metrics": {
    "total_documents": 464,
    "documents_by_status": {
      "pending": 0,
      "ocr_processing": 0, 
      "ocr_completed": 1,
      "ocr_failed": 463
    },
    "success_rate": "0.22%",
    "failure_rate": "99.78%"
  }
}
```

### 2. Sample Failed Documents

```json
// Failed Document Examples
[
  {
    "document_uuid": "9e6d52c1-9cbc-4c0e-a039-e5a8f0231a62",
    "file_name": "Paul, Michael - Acuity Answer to Counterclaim 1-23-25.pdf",
    "celery_status": "ocr_failed",
    "celery_task_id": "f5b4c8a7-3d2e-4f1a-9c6b-8e7a5b4c3d2f"
  },
  {
    "document_uuid": "a7c3d2e1-5b4f-4a8c-9d6e-3f2a1b7c8e9d", 
    "file_name": "Paul, Michael - JDH EOA 1-27-25.docx",
    "celery_status": "ocr_failed",
    "celery_task_id": "e8d7c6b5-a4f3-e2d1-c9b8-7f6e5d4c3b2a"
  }
]
```

### 3. Environment Configuration Mismatch

**System Environment (Used by Celery Workers):**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL: https://zwixwazwmaipzzcrwhzr.supabase.co  # WRONG INSTANCE
```

**.env File (Correct Configuration):**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://yalswdiexcuanszujjhl.supabase.co  # CORRECT INSTANCE
```

### 4. Process Evidence

**Import Script Output (Successful):**
```
✅ Total files imported: 464/464 (100.00% success)
Total cost estimate: $1,070.46
Processing time: 408.34 seconds
```

**Worker Process Status:**
```bash
# Multiple Celery workers running with wrong environment
josephott 49805 ... celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
josephott 67658 ... celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
josephott 16766 ... celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --logfile=logs/celery-general-%n.log
josephott 16765 ... celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --logfile=logs/celery-graph-%n.log
josephott 16763 ... celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --logfile=logs/celery-text-%n.log
josephott 16762 ... celery -A scripts.celery_app worker --logfile=logs/celery-ocr-%n.log
```

### 5. Diagnostic Test Results

**AWS Connectivity Test (Successful):**
```
Testing AWS/S3 connection...
✅ S3 connection successful! Bucket samu-docs-private-upload accessible
✅ Textract client created successfully
```

This confirms AWS services are properly configured and accessible.

### 6. Log File Status

All Celery log files are empty (0 bytes), indicating either:
- Workers are logging to stdout instead of files
- Log rotation has occurred
- Workers started with incorrect logging configuration

```bash
-rw-r--r--  1 josephott  staff  0 May 26 23:13 celery-general-general.log
-rw-r--r--  1 josephott  staff  0 May 26 23:13 celery-graph-graph.log
-rw-r--r--  1 josephott  staff  0 May 26 23:13 celery-ocr-ocr.log
-rw-r--r--  1 josephott  staff  0 May 26 23:13 celery-text-text.log
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Environment Variable Loading Issue**: The Celery workers were started before the .env file was updated, or they're not loading the .env file properly.

2. **Database Instance Mismatch**: 
   - Import script used: `yalswdiexcuanszujjhl` (correct)
   - Celery workers using: `zwixwazwmaipzzcrwhzr` (incorrect)
   - This causes workers to look for documents in the wrong database

3. **Worker Startup Sequence**: The `start_celery_workers.sh` script likely doesn't source the .env file before starting workers, relying on system environment variables instead.

## Impact Assessment

- **99.8% Failure Rate**: Only 1 document successfully processed out of 464
- **Complete Pipeline Stall**: No documents progressing beyond OCR stage
- **Resource Waste**: Workers continuously failing but not logging errors properly
- **Project Timeline Impact**: Entire Acuity v. Wombat document set unusable

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Actions

1. **Stop all Celery workers**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/stop_celery_workers.sh
   ```

2. **Update worker startup script** to source .env:
   ```bash
   # Add to start_celery_workers.sh
   source .env
   export SUPABASE_URL=$SUPABASE_URL
   ```

3. **Restart workers with correct environment**:
   ```bash
   source .env && ./scripts/start_celery_workers.sh
   ```

4. **Reset failed documents**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE source_documents 
   SET celery_status = 'pending', 
       celery_task_id = NULL,
       initial_processing_status = 'pending'
   WHERE celery_status = 'ocr_failed'
   AND projectId = 'e74deac0-1f9e-45a9-9b5f-9fa08d67527c';
   ```

5. **Resubmit documents** for processing

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Environment Management**:
   - Use explicit environment loading in all scripts
   - Add environment validation at worker startup
   - Implement health checks that verify correct database connection

2. **Logging Improvements**:
   - Configure Celery to log errors even with connection failures
   - Add startup logs showing which environment is being used
   - Implement centralized logging for all workers

3. **Monitoring Enhancements**:
   - Add alerts for high failure rates
   - Monitor which database instance workers are connected to
   - Track environment configuration mismatches

## Conclusion

The mass OCR failures are not due to technical issues with AWS Textract or document processing logic, but rather a simple environment configuration mismatch. The import succeeded because it forced the correct environment, while the Celery workers inherited an outdated system environment. This is a critical but easily fixable configuration issue that has completely stalled the processing pipeline.

## Evidence Summary

- **Failure Rate**: 463/464 documents (99.8%)
- **Root Cause**: Wrong SUPABASE_URL in worker environment
- **Proof**: System env shows `zwixwazwmaipzzcrwhzr`, .env file has `yalswdiexcuanszujjhl`
- **Impact**: Complete pipeline stall at OCR stage
- **Fix**: Restart workers with correct environment variables
