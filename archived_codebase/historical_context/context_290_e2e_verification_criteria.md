# End-to-End Testing Verification Criteria for Legal Document Processing Pipeline

## Date: 2025-06-01
## Purpose: Comprehensive E2E Testing of Document Intake Processing
## Status: VERIFICATION CRITERIA DEFINED

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive verification criteria for end-to-end testing of the legal document processing pipeline, specifically for documents in the `/opt/legal-doc-processor/document_intake/` directory. The testing will validate that the system can process real legal documents from intake through complete knowledge graph generation, with all intermediate stages functioning correctly and automatically.

## System Architecture Overview

The pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. **Document Intake**: Upload to S3 and database registration
2. **OCR Processing**: AWS Textract with async job handling
3. **Text Chunking**: Semantic segmentation with overlap
4. **Entity Extraction**: OpenAI-based NER for legal entities
5. **Entity Resolution**: Deduplication and canonicalization
6. **Relationship Building**: Graph staging for Neo4j
7. **Pipeline Finalization**: Status updates and notifications

## Verification Criteria

### 1. Pre-Processing Verification

#### 1.1 Document Intake
- **Criterion**: All documents in `/document_intake/` are successfully uploaded to S3
- **Success Metrics**:
  - S3 upload returns valid URLs
  - Document metadata stored in database
  - File integrity verified (MD5 hash match)
  - Processing status set to 'pending'

#### 1.2 Database Registration

  - All required fields populated (file_name, file_path, mime_type)
  - Project association established
  - Created timestamps are current

### 2. Processing Stage Verification

#### 2.1 OCR Processing

- **Success Metrics**:
  - Failed tasks retry automatically (up to 3 times)
  - Error messages logged with full context
  - Partial failures don't block pipeline
  - Failed documents marked appropriately

### 5. Monitoring and Observability

#### 5.1 State Tracking
- **Criterion**: All state transitions are trackable
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Redis contains state for each stage
  - State transitions logged with timestamps
  - Pipeline monitor shows real-time progress
  - Historical state preserved for debugging

#### 5.2 Logging
- **Criterion**: Comprehensive logging at all stages
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Each task logs start/end with timing
  - Errors include full stack traces
  - Document UUID in all log entries
  - Log levels appropriate (INFO/WARNING/ERROR)

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Test Document Selection
- Select 5-10 representative documents from `/document_intake/`
- Include variety: different sizes, formats, content types
- Ensure mix of simple and complex documents

### 2. Test Execution Steps

1. **Clean State**
   ```bash
   # Clear any existing test data
   python scripts/legacy/cleanup/cleanup_test_documents.py
   ```

2. **Start Monitoring**
   ```bash
   python scripts/cli/monitor.py live
   ```

3. **Import Documents**
   ```bash
   python scripts/cli/import.py --directory /opt/legal-doc-processor/document_intake/
   ```

4. **Track Progress**
   - Monitor state transitions in real-time
   - Check Redis for intermediate results
   - Verify database updates

5. **Validate Results**
   - Query final data
   - Check entity quality
   - Verify relationships

### 3. Success Determination

The test is considered **SUCCESSFUL** when:

1. **All documents reach 'completed' status** within 15 minutes
2. **No critical errors** in logs (warnings acceptable)
3. **Data quality metrics** meet thresholds:
   - Entity extraction: >80% accuracy
   - Chunking coverage: >95%
   - Relationship confidence: >0.7 average
4. **System remains stable** (no crashes, memory leaks)
5. **Monitoring shows continuous progress** (no stuck states)

### 4. Failure Modes

The test **FAILS** if:

1. Any document remains in 'processing' state > 15 minutes
2. Critical errors occur without recovery
3. Data corruption detected (missing chunks, duplicate entities)
4. System crashes or runs out of memory
5. Less than 80% of documents complete successfully

## Key Verification Areas

- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU within limits
- **Concurrent Safety**: No race conditions
- **State Consistency**: Accurate status tracking

### 4. Performance Benchmarks
- **OCR**: < 2 minutes per document
- **Chunking**: < 30 seconds per document
- **Entity Extraction**: < 1 minute per document
- **Total Pipeline**: < 10 minutes per document

## Validation Queries

### Check Document Status
```sql
SELECT document_uuid, file_name, processing_status, 
       created_at, updated_at
FROM source_documents
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Verify Chunking Coverage
```sql
SELECT d.document_uuid, d.file_name,
       COUNT(c.chunk_uuid) as chunk_count,
       AVG(c.word_count) as avg_words
FROM source_documents d
LEFT JOIN document_chunks c ON d.document_uuid = c.document_uuid
GROUP BY d.document_uuid, d.file_name;
```

### Entity Extraction Summary
```sql
SELECT d.file_name, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT em.entity_mention_uuid) as mention_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT ce.canonical_entity_uuid) as canonical_count
FROM source_documents d
LEFT JOIN entity_mentions em ON d.document_uuid = em.document_uuid
LEFT JOIN canonical_entities ce ON em.canonical_entity_uuid = ce.canonical_entity_uuid
GROUP BY d.file_name;
```

## Conclusion

This comprehensive verification criteria ensures that the legal document processing pipeline is thoroughly tested from intake through completion. Success requires not just technical completion but also quality thresholds that demonstrate the system's readiness for production use. The testing methodology provides clear, measurable criteria for determining whether the system meets its intended purpose of extracting structured knowledge from unstructured legal documents.
